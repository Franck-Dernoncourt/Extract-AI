"Carlos Tevez has rocked Juventus by revealing that he wants to leave the club and return to Argentina at the end of the season. Tevez is under contract until the end of next season but according to reports in Italy he has told the club's hierarchy he wants to leave this summer. The former Manchester United, Manchester City and West Ham striker has always made clear that he hopes to finish his career at Boca Juniors in Argentina, but the move was not expected so soon. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer . Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory . However, Italian paper Corriere della Sera insist that the club will not stand in Tevez's way, and that they have simply asked him to give his all until June. Tevez's international manager Tata Martino claims any potential move would have no bearing on the player's Argentina future. 'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors. It wouldn't be a step down.' Italian paper Tuttosport calims Tevez has already decided to leave the club this summer . Tevez has always said he intends to finish his career back at his first club Boca Juniors in Argentina ."
"Graeme Finlay leaving Teesside Crown Court today. He is accused of attacking husband and wife Ronald and June Phillips while on board a cruise ship . After enjoying dinner, an evening show and a drink in the cruise ship’s cabaret bar, Ron and June Phillips headed to their cabin clutching cups of cocoa. But their relaxing night on the luxury liner was shattered by a violent confrontation that left both unconscious. The elderly couple were ambushed outside their room by a passenger who had earlier sat with them in the restaurant and claims that he was snubbed, a court heard yesterday. Graeme Finlay, 53, says he was ‘ignored’ when he joined their table and so moved to another after looking at the menu. He claims Mr Phillips, 70, later struck him with his crutch during a confrontation but the couple say they were ambushed. Mr Phillips and his 69-year-old wife were on a 14-night holiday based in the Canary Islands, which involved seven nights on the Thomson Celebration ship and seven nights in a hotel. Describing the horrific night in January last year – when the liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote – Mr Phillips told the court he had drunk about three gin and tonics when he and his wife headed back to their cabin. Mr Phillips walked with a crutch because of a hip replacement operation and his wife also suffered from limited mobility due to osteoarthritis. He told Teesside Crown Court that he was holding both cups of hot chocolate in one hand and his crutch in the other when they were set upon as they entered their room. Mr Phillips said he was about to follow his wife into the cabin when he spotted someone out of the corner of his eye. The couple were travelling on a Thomson Celebration cruise ship when they were viciously attacked. The liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote when it is alleged Graeme Finlay beat the frail, elderly pair . ‘The next thing I knew I came to with people all around me,’ he said. ‘There seemed to be blood everywhere and broken hot chocolate mugs. I only remember one punch to my head and I was knocked out.’ In her evidence, Mrs Phillips said: ‘I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof [she made a punching motion]. 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him, “leave him alone, you will kill him”.’ Prosecutor Lewis Kerr told the court that Mr Phillips suffered facial injuries. His wife was pushed against a wall and also knocked unconscious. She was found to have suffered two broken vertebrae. The crew of the Celebration found bed sheets and a T-shirt in Finlay’s cabin with blood marks. He was not on the ship, which was in port at the time of the discovery, but when he returned he was told to make his own way back to his home in Glasgow. Mr Kerr said: ‘The defendant was interviewed by the police and explained he had an argument with Mr and Mrs Phillips. ‘He accepts he hit Mr Phillips but didn’t accept causing the injuries to Mrs Phillips. He said he was only ever acting in self-defence.’ Teesside Crown Court, pictured, heard how crew members discovered a bloodstained T-shirt and bed sheets in Mr Finlay's cabin. He denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm . It was alleged that after dinner Finlay had shared a lift with Mr and Mrs Phillips and told them: ‘You ignored me, I want an apology.’ Peter Kilgour, defending, put it to Mr Phillips that he swore at the defendant and ‘lashed out at him’ with his crutch. Mr Phillips replied: ‘No. Never in my life have I hit anyone, not even my wife, you can ask her.’ He said there was no row in the lift and that he was attacked without warning. He also denied snubbing Finlay at dinner, insisting: ‘I wouldn’t ignore someone who had sat down at my table. We were in the restaurant for 45 minutes to an hour and didn’t see him again. We just chatted to the other couple. There was no disagreement.’ Finlay denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm. The case continues.

"Midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate has warned West Ham must be ready to face a 'wounded animal' at Manchester City on Sunday, but will be ready to inflict more pain on Manuel Pellegrini's men. The Barclays Premier League champions have seen their title defence left in tatters following a run of four defeats in six matches, thrashed 4-2 at rivals United last weekend - a result which left the long-term future of manager Pellegrini in doubt as City might now face a scrap with Liverpool for a Champions League qualifying spot. West Ham are also in need a pick-me-up, having seen victory slip through their fingers when Stoke netted a stoppage time equaliser at Upton Park. West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate is wary of facing champions Manchester City on Sunday . City midfielder Yaya Toure (centre) and his team-mates suffered a 4-2 defeat at Old Trafford last week . Senegal midfielder Kouyate expects City to produce a response, but also one from Sam Allardyce's squad, who have failed to find consistency over the second half of the season to drop out of contention for the European places. 'Anything is possible in football, but we mustn't forget who we are up against. They are a wounded animal, because they need points, so they have to wake themselves up to win,' Kouyate said on the club's official website, www.whufc.com. 'We need the points as well, because we want to remain in the top 10. 'It is not going to be easy because we will be up against one of the best teams in the country and last year's champions of England. 'If we are going to get anything there, we have to enjoy it and really play as a team and work as a team.' Kouyate celebrates with left back Aaron Cresswell after his goal against Stoke at Upton Park last Saturday . Marouane Fellaini (right) scores United's second goal as City fell to another Premier League defeat . Kouyate added: 'A team like Manchester City can't afford to make mistakes, so for us it's a good time to face them, but we mustn't underestimate them, there's life in them yet.' West Ham look short of options in attack. Striker Enner Valencia is being assessed for a foot injury picked up on his return to action against Stoke, while Diafra Sakho, who has netted 12 goals in all competitions, is facing a battle to play again this season following a thigh strain. Allardyce is hoping his team can produce the required level of concentration to accommodate their forward losses. He said: 'That leaves us very short on the front line with Andy (Carroll) being out, and means goals will be fewer and farther between than they used to be, so if we don't get that defensive side right then the last six games are going to be tough for us.'"
"Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy (above) in the head . Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday night and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy in the head, leaving him critically injured. The suspect, who is described as Hispanic, medium build and wearing a grey hoodie at the time, apparently had no motive for staging the attack in the 11000 block of Wagner Street in Del Rey. According to the victim's father, the attacker walked in through an unlocked front door around midnight and proceeded to fire shots after a heated conversation. The father then ran into the boy's bedroom to shield him as the gunman followed shooting, authorities said. Ammunition plowed through the wall and the bedroom door, although it was unclear which bullets struck the boy. The lath and plaster of the wall are believed to have slowed the shots. The boy was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he underwent surgery for a head wound. As of Monday, he was listed in critical but stable condition. His great-aunt confirmed to NBC LA that his condition was continuing to improve. 'I know that at some point he did say something. They said he was going to be OK,' she said. No other family members were injured in the incident. The young victim's mother and 17-year-old brother were also reported to be in the bedroom,  while the boy's grandmother was in another room. Apparently the front door and security gate had been left open as the father had been expecting his 20-year-old son to return. Scene of the crime: The suspect, who is described as Hispanic, medium build and wearing a grey hoodie at the time, apparently had no motive for staging the attack in the 11000 block of Wagner Street in Del Rey . Unprovoked: According to the victim's father, the attacker walked in through an unlocked front door around midnight and proceeded to fire shots after a heated conversation . Shootings are rare in the residential neighborhood, police said. Indeed, neighbors told CBS News that the family has lived in the residence for more than a decade with no problem. 'According to the family, they did not recognize the suspect' and there was nothing in the house that indicated drugs or other illegal activity, Los Angeles Police Capt. Nicole Alberca said at a news conference Monday afternoon. The names of the family members have been withheld but a photo of the boy has been released. The image shows him smiling with long, wavy, golden-brown hair down to his shoulders. Although the gunman is believed to have fled on foot, anyone who may have seen a vehicle leaving the area is urged to call Los Angeles Regional Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS."
"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Gunmen stormed the headquarters of Somalia's education ministry in the country's capital on Tuesday after a suicide car bombing, a two-pronged attack that killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others, officials said. The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of Mogadishu, group spokesman Abu Musab said. The attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two-story building housing the Ministry of Education, Culture & Higher Education, Somali National Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf said. Five gunmen then entered the building, shooting people inside, Yusuf said. Security guards at the building, and, later, Somali special forces battled the gunmen inside, witnesses said. Soldiers from the African Union, who are in Somalia in part to support the government's fight against Al-Shabaab, teamed up with Somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers, Yusuf said. The attack killed four Somali soldiers and eight civilians, according to Yusuf. The special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway, city police Capt. Mohamud Abdi said. Ali Hassan, a man who was helped from the building, confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has battled the country's government for years, aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist Islamic state. In recent years, the group also launched terror attacks beyond Somalia's borders, sometimes targeting non-Muslims. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in neighboring Kenya, killing 147 people, mostly students. The terrorists separated Christians from Muslims and shot those who couldn't recite verses from the Quran, witnesses said. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Late last month, Al-Shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a Mogadishu hotel, leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours. Among those killed was Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta."
"A Chicago Cubs fan managed to catch a foul ball in her cup of beer during a game against the San Diego Padres on Saturday afternoon. The woman, identified as 24-year-old Krista Dotzenrod from Minnesota by the Chicago Sun Times, said it was 'pure luck.' 'I was sitting there, and all of a sudden there is a ball in my cup. It fell straight in there.' Scroll down for video... Caught! A woman at a game in Chicago who snagged a foul ball in her full cup of beer in the ninth inning on Saturday . Prime position: Ms. Dotzenrod said  she was sitting in her seats in the second row near third base . I'll drink to that! 24-year-old Krista Dotzenrod from Minnesota not only caught the foul ball hit at the game pitting the Cubs against Padres, but then chugged the beer in celebration . Quite the catch! Ms. Dotzenrod has received a number of messages asking if she is single . Within seconds of capturing the ball in her ale, she chugged the beer down with the ball still inside the cup to the delight of fans around her. Ms. Dotzenrod then posted a picture of her lucky catch on Instagram . 'Everyone behind me told me to chug my beer,' she said. 'So I did!' It all happened in five seconds,' said Dotzenrod, who has lived in Chicago for seven years. 'I chugged the beer and wished the Cubs a great year. The ball is now sitting in my apartment.' Soon afterwards, she became the object of attention as dozens of admirers on Twitter began to ask if they could go on a date with her. MLB.com reports the chances of catching a foul ball sit at roughly one in 1,189, with the odds of catching the ball in a full glass of beer, far smaller! The Cubs won the game, 7-6, in 11 innings. Game to remember: 'It all happened in five seconds. ... I chugged the beer and wished the Cubs a great year. The ball is now sitting in my apartment,' she said. Growing trend: Many fans who are either glove-less or holding a beer have now decided to use their cup as a catching device for foul balls ."
"Cristiano Ronaldo only needed 288 games to score 300 goals for Real Madrid and he has been presented with a special shirt to mark his achievements  by club president Florentino Perez. Ronaldo, 30, scored the landmark goal against Rayo Vallecano on April 8 and only trails Raul (323) and Alfredo di Stefano (307)  in the scoring charts for the Spanish giants. And after training on Friday Ronaldo posed with the commemorative '300' strip alongside his team-mates in Madrid. Cristiano Ronaldo was presented with a shit with '300 goals' on the back by Real Madrid club president Florentino Perez on Friday . Ronaldo reached the landmark figure in only his 288th game for the club against Rayo Vallecano on April 8 . Ronaldo's Real Madrid team-mates including Gareth Bale embrace the Portuguese forward after he scored his 300th goal for the club . The Portuguese forward has only taken six years to reach the figure in all competitions, having signed for the club for a then world-record fee of £80million from Manchester United. He has also claimed two Ballon d'Or awards in that time, while competing with Barcelona's star man Lionel Messi. Real Madrid host Malaga this weekend as they look to narrow the gap between themselves and Barca at the top of La Liga, but Ronaldo won't be linking up with Karim Benzema. The French striker picked up a knee injury in Tuesday's 0-0 Champions League quarter-final first leg draw at Atletico Madrid. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed the news in his pre-match press conferesnce, saying: 'Benzema is not available [for Saturday] but we will have him back for the next game [Atletico Madrid]' French striker Karim Benzema will miss Real Madrid's clash against Malaga on Saturday with a knee injury .

"An eccentric man is fighting to keep his driving licence photo as a picture of him with a colander on his head because it is his 'religious right'. Ian Harris, 51, from Brighton, East Sussex, is a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster whose followers, known as Pastafarians, regard the pasta strainer as a religious garment. He is challenging the DVLA over his rights to wear the metal bowl in his licence photo, which he says is equivalent to Muslim women being pictured in hijabs. Ian Harris is a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, whose followers believe the colander is a religious garment and he is fighting with the DVLA for his right to wear one in his driving licence photo . The father-of-one has already been turned down once by the government agency but has sent off a fresh photo wearing the headgear in a second bid. Mr Harris said: 'I'm fighting for the right to have my religious headgear shown on my photo. I don't understand the DVLA should be able to discriminate whether my religion is valid. 'I have a spiritual connection with the Flying Spaghetti Monster, until they have brain probes how are they going to say I don't? 'Our religion is a minority but the DVLA is discriminating because it allows people who practise major religions to wear headgear in pictures.' The musician had his appeal rejected last month but hopes to emulate fellow believer Niko Alm from Austria, who won the legal right to wear the headgear in his licence photo in 2011. Mr Alm sent off for the licence in 2008 and he was invited to the doctor's to check he was mentally fit to drive, but after three years, his efforts finally paid off. Mr Harris began following the religion, along with his daughter Astri, 4, after it was set up in the USA in 2005 to protest the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in science classes. Members claim to believe that an invisible alien made of spaghetti and meatballs created the universe after 'drinking heavily.' According to its tongue-in-cheek website their 'only dogma ... is the rejection of dogma'. Rejection: Mr Harris has already been turned down once by the government agency but has sent off a fresh photo wearing the headgear and in a second bid . A DVLA spokesman said: 'The photograph must be clear and be a current likeness to allow the Police to link the driver to driving entitlement held without confusion or ambiguity. 'Headgear is generally not acceptable, but may be permissible on religious or medical grounds and any exemptions are dealt with on a case by case basis.' Religious exemptions include the Sikh turban and the Islamic Hijab. Mr Harris, who plays banjo in The Iron Boot Scrapers, vows to fight his corner until he runs out of appeals when he will be forced to send a photo of him without the colander. He said: 'When I get to the final appeal I will have to send a photo without a colander but that would be a bad day for religious freedom.' Other countries including the United States, Austria and the Czech Republic allow Pastafarians to wear the metal sieves in their licence pictures. The Austrian authorities allowed Niko Alm to wear the unusual headgear as it is deemed a suitable accessory for his 'Pastafarian' religion . Shawna Hammon from Oklahoma was allowed to pose for her driver's license wearing a spaghetti strainer on her head because it falls under the state's rules for religious headwear . In September last year Shawna Hammond from Oklahoma, U.S. was granted permission to wear one in her licence photograph. She said  the photo obeyed the state's laws that requires people remove their glasses and wear a religious headpiece that does not cover their face, create shadows, or display text or logos. Earlier that year, Christopher Schaeffer, a council member in Pomfret, New York wore a colander on his head as he was sworn into office. In 2013, a Czech man was allowed to wear the headgear on his official identity card after officials ruled that turning down his request would be a breach of the country's religious equality laws. In 2005, a physics graduate from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a form of protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow the teaching of Intelligent Design as an alternative to evolution in public schools. By professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and meatballs, Bobby Henderson, 24, called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time in science classrooms alongside Christian theory. Word rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in Europe. The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'."
"Talk about gobby! This little fellow has been born with FIVE mouths - believed to be the most ever seen on a calf. The strange-looking baby opens all ten lips when he is sucking at his mother's udders. But he can only take in milk through two of his mouths. He is being fed three times a day at the dairy farm where he was born, in Narnaul, northern India. Scroll down for video . On everyone's lips: This calf in northern India has five mouths and is attracting a stream of human visitors . Normal body: From the neck down the baby, who has been called Nandi, looks like any other calf . Dinner time: Nandi sucks from his mother's udders with one of his mouths. She feeds him three times a day . Shocked locals have called the calf Nandi - a nickname for Lord Krishna. It can also mean 'one who pleases others'. In India's Hindu culture, cows are revered as a symbol of life. Nandi is attracting a constant stream of visitors wanting to celebrate him. Many of them kneel before him to pray and touch his hooves. Local vet Sukhbir Singh said that despite Nandi's appearance, he is healthy and thriving. But the calf's two eyes are positioned in such a way on his distorted head that he can only see to his sides and can't look in front of him. One eye is blue and the other black. Other strange-looking bovine have been recorded in recent years, including a buffalo with three mouths and three eyes that was in in 2009, also in northern India, in 2009. Last month a bull with two faces - one on top the other - was sold to an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. The 440kg animal fetched around £300 in the auction at Mareeba Livestock Yard. Celebrating him: Local schoolchildren kneel and pray at Nandi's feet. Cows are revered in the Hindu faith . Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too. Two-faced: This 440kg bull, which has faces on top of each other, was sold to an abattoir last month . Double-headed: The female calf born that was born in Whiting, Vermont, two years ago . Tired out: Both her mouths sucked at the same time because they were operated by a single brain ."
"You might know that H20 is the chemical formula for water, but what about the chemistry of you? Dr Joe Hanson, a science writer and biologist based in Austin, Texas, pondered this very question and now has calculated what the human body is in terms of chemical elements. He revealed that a 'human molecule' might contain 375 million atoms of hydrogen, 132 million atoms of oxygen and 85 million atoms of carbon. By comparison, this human molecule contains just one atom of cobalt and three molecules of the metal molybdenum. When written out in full, the human molecule would read: Co1 Mo3 Se4 Cr7 F13 Mn13 I14 Cu76 Zn2,110 Fe2,680 Si38,600 Mg40,000 Cl127,000 K177,000 Na183,000 S206,000 P1,020,000 Ca1,500,000 N6,430,000 C85,700,000 O132,000,000 H375,000,000. The full list of elements that Dr Hanson says would be found in a human molecule if such a thing existed - each set of letters represent a chemical element and the numbers are the proporation of atoms in each 'molecule' Dr Hanson claims his formula, however, only represents the chemical make up of the human body at birth. Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Over our lifetimes the proportions of these elements change as age and we pick up traces of other elements like heavy metals and gold. Dr Hanson said: 'Out of 98 naturally occurring elements, just over 30 are known to be essential to some form of life on Earth. 'In ancient times scholars believed everything in the universe was made from just four elements - earth, water, fire and air. 'Today we know it is a little more complicated than that. Living things are made up of cells, cells are made up of molecules and molecules are made up of atoms. 'But that old idea turns out to be sort of right. 'Altogether, 97% of the mass all living matter is made of just four chemical elements.' Dr Hanson, who created the video for the It's Okay to be Smart PBS channel on YouTube, also calculated that the average human body has the equivalent of 16kg (35lbs) of carbon in it and enough oxygen to fill a volume equivalent to 6 elephants. He said the human body also contained enough hydrogen to fill the volume of a blue whale and the same amount of nitrogen as is found in 400 litres of urine. But the human body may also be a source of revenue for those who think it is worth the effort. If the average person was to cut off all their tails and toenails, they could extract a nugget of gold worth around a tenth of a US cent (one sixteenth of a penny), according to Dr Hanson. He said: 'The average adult contains detectable amounts of 60 elements, mostly just traces of our diet and environment that have built up over time. If you isolated all of the elements in your body into their pure form, the ingredients for one life would fetch around one to two thousands dollars on the open market. 'Of course you can't really do that, but it gives us another way to look at life.' Biologist Dr Joe Hanson has worked out what the human body would look like as a chemical formula (above) The average adult human body contains around 16kg (35lbs) of carbon.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up in front of the Kabul Bank in Jalalabad early Saturday, a local government spokesman said. The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. ""The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,"" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of ""Khorasan."" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. ""The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,"" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. ""You do have some of the Taliban breaking off and claiming allegiance toward ISIS,"" Campbell said, attributing the phenomenon partly to a feeling of disenfranchisement on the parts of some Taliban members -- who, he said, may use ISIS tactics to gain media attention. CNN's Brian Walker, Ben Brumfield and Don Melvin contributed to this report."
"Stan Collymore, talkSPORT lead football pundit who revels in laying down the law on the radio, astonished reporters with his behaviour during Aston Villa’s 3-3 Premier League draw with QPR on Tuesday night. Collymore, despite sitting in the Villa Park press box where media impartiality is taken for granted, was jumping up and down during the game like the most fanatical Villa fan, celebrating the goals with the home supporters. He even greeted QPR’s Joey Barton falling down to win a free-kick by clearly shouting at him: ‘You f****** rat.’ talkSport pundit Stan Collymore was in full fan mode as he celebrated Villa's 3-3 draw with QPR . The former Villa striker let loose with his wild, and sometimes expletive laden, comments from the press box . Villa fan Collymore believed such actions in the supposed neutral sanctuary of the press box were permissible as he wasn’t working for talkSPORT during the match. He tweeted: ‘With respect, on nights I go as a fan . . . I’m not being paid to do anything other than be a fan.’ And talkSPORT would not comment as they said Collymore wasn’t on duty, with reporter Nigel Pearson giving his rather more impartial verdict for the station. However Collymore did an interview with Adrian Durham and Darren Gough on talkSPORT before the match. Collymore called Joey Barton a 'f*****g rat' after he fell down to win a free-kick for QPR during the game . Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire’s highly-rated championship-winning coach also in charge of Big Bash team Adelaide Strikers, is hardly your archetypal red-meat-eating Aussie fast bowler. Gillespie, who would be first choice for England as well if Peter Moores fails in the West Indies, is preparing for new season by becoming a vegan. Meanwhile Lancashire’s supporters’ action group are questioning the value of having Sky Sports commentator Paul Allott on the club board after Peter Siddle, Lancashire’s overseas signing, was selected for Australia’s tours of the West Indies and England, ruling him out of any county involvement. Yorkshire's championship winning coach Jason Gillespie is preparing for the season with a new diet . Bookmakers Paddy Power, rabid publicists guaranteed to offend, have a new stunt showing Ruby Walsh supposedly preparing for the Grand National by jumping his horse over a speeding car. The YouTube video is plainly mocked up but, with sensitivities around animal welfare, it was crass of Walsh, jump racing’s pre-eminent jockey after AP McCoy’s forthcoming retirement, to involve himself in such a provocative spoof — even if he is a Paddy Power ambassador. Ruby Walsh and horse clear a car, claimed to be travelling at 40mph,  as part of the Grand National countdown . The split between FA chairman Greg Dyke and vice-chairman David Gill over homegrown players became very apparent during Wednesday's FA council meeting. After Dyke gave his well-received presentation, Manchester United director Gill, with his Premier League hat on, told council that Dyke should have said ‘I’ rather than ‘we’ as the issue had yet to be debated by the FA board. Gill wants the consultation period to be a proper process starting at board level — during which no doubt the Premier League will try to hijack it. So the big question is whether Dyke is willing to use the rulebook to force it through. FA chairman Greg Dyke still faces a challenge to convince everyone over plans to change homegrown quota . Gordon faces scrutiny . Michael Gordon, American representative on daily Liverpool business for the club’s Fenway Sports Group owners, likes to operate well away from the media spotlight. However Boston Red Sox baseball shareholder Gordon might soon have to explain his major involvement in a number of signings that haven’t worked out as well as current contract stand-offs if Liverpool’s season were to further unravel. It’s understood Gordon’s high opinion of Liverpool’s pulling power and ability to keep players might have been swayed rather too much by their brief presence in the Champions League. Michael Gordon may have to explain why several signings, such as Mario Balotelli, have not worked out . Channel 4 racing missing the start of an all-weather championship race at Lingfield last Friday because of an ad break could come back to haunt them. Arena Racing Company, the largest UK racing group are understood to have paid for the TV production costs as part of the Lingfield promotion that attracted a 9,000 crowd. Meanwhile ARC are looking to invite people supportive of their all-weather racing track at Newcastle for a celebratory launch when they receive the go-ahead for the plans discussed by the British Horseracing Authority board yesterday. However those in favour of the flat turf being dug up on the Newcastle mile are very hard to find."
"Twelve months ago, Liverpool were a free-flowing, potent attacking force with the SS (Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge) firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of Liverpool's 101 goals in the Premier League.This season, however, the goals have dried up. Replacing Suarez was always going to be a near-impossible task, but Liverpool fans would have started the season quietly confident that the quality was there to collectively make up for the Uruguayan's absence. Unfortunately for Brendan Rodgers, things in the final third have not quite clicked in the final third in the way they did last season. Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge (right) scored 52 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season . Raheem Sterling has struggled in front of goal this season, scoring only scored six Premier League goals . Jordan Henderson (centre) celebrates scoring sixth goal of the season, a penalty against Arsenal on Saturday . With just seven games of the season left Liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard - have scored six goals each. To put that into context, only Crystal Palace (Dwight Gayle and Mile Jedinak - four) and Sunderland (Adam Johnson and Steven Fletcher - four) have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool. while Aston Villa's top scorers Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor have also only managed six each. What the stats clearly show is that Liverpool have not filled the void left by Suarez, they are missing a Harry Kane (19 goals), a Diego Costa (also 19), a Sergio Aguero (17), even a Charlie Austin (16 goals) - and it has cost them dearly. Harry Kane (centre) didn't score against Burnley on Sunday, but has 19 Premier League goals this season . Diego Costa is the joint top scorer in the Premier League with 19 goals in his first season in England . Liverpool fans would argue that in Sturridge, who scored 21 league goals last term, they do have a player capable of scoring 20+ goals a season - and they are right. The England striker has had a frustrating season due to various injuries, and that is unfortunate, but Liverpool's others goal threats - Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert - simply haven't met the standards set by the SS last season. Some may also argue that while Liverpool lack a single focal point in attack, the group as a whole have picked up the slack. That may be true to an extent but Kane and Costa have scored more than Sterling, Henderson and Gerrard combined. And there can be little doubt that had Sturridge remained fit all season he would have more than six Premier League goals by this stage of the season. The are mitigating circumstances for Liverpool, no doubt, but the stats don't lie and the fact that no one person has grabbed the mantle left by Suarez or Sturridge has proven costly for Liverpool - and may be a crucial reason why they miss out on Champions League football next season. Only Sunderland and Crystal Palace have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool this season. ARSENAL - Alexis Sánchez, Olivier Giroud. 14. ASTON VILLA - Christian Benteke, Gabriel Agbonlahor. 6. BURNLEY - Danny Ings. 9. CHELSEA - Diego Costa. 19. CRYSTAL PALACE - Dwight Gayle, Mile Jedinak. 5. EVERTON - Romelu Lukaku. 8.

"Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another ‘tough year’. The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a £446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside £856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra £334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a £446million loss in the first three months of the year . In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a £453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the £46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 . Chief executive Ross McEwan said: ‘This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.’ The latest news wiped more than £700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power. The disgraced former boss of RBS, Fred Goodwin, was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Goodwin – nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting – was even knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. ‘It’s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.’"
"Interested parties have begun due diligence on West Brom as the sale of the club edges closer. The Baggies are on the market with chairman Jeremy Peace understood to want between £150million and £200million for the club. Groups from America, Australia and the Far East are believed to be interested in buying Albion after Peace confirmed he would be open to offers in February. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is hoping to sell the club for between £150million and £200million . Manager Tony Pulis has been assured that the deal will be done by July, so as not to affect pre-season . He has set a July deadline to complete any deal to ensure it does not drag out and hamper their summer transfer plans under head coach Tony Pulis. Should he fail to sell the club, though, then Peace, who has been chairman for 13 years, will remain committed to Albion, who are on course to seal a sixth straight season in the Barclays Premier League. Pulis said on Monday he was unaware of any imminent sale but Peace has given him assurances it will not drag on over the summer. Any due diligence of the Hawthorns club is likely to be helped after they announced pre-tax profits of £14.7million up to end of June 2014 in February. The Baggies are 13th in the Barclays Premier League, seven points clear of the relegation zone, with four games left and go to Manchester United on Saturday. Pulis has led West Brom to 13th in the Premier League after taking over when they were in danger of relegation ."
"Just over a year ago, Adam Johnson sat in a room with journalists at the Stadium of Light and talked about England and the forthcoming World Cup. He wasn’t sharing his opinion as a former international, but as one who genuinely hoped his exile was about to come to a deserved end. Johnson — scorer of seven goals in as many matches for Sunderland —believed he was worthy of a recall, 21 months on from a five-minute cameo in Norway’s Ullevaal Stadium during a Euro 2012 warm-up friendly. Adam Johnson (right) was accompanied by his lawyer as he was charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming . Johnson, an England international, was considered a prospect for Roy Hodgson as recently as a year ago . Johnson (right) was wearing a black tracksuit as he arrived at Peterlee police station on Thursday . At 26, was it plausible that Johnson had rediscovered the fearless form many suspected he had left behind on Teesside when he quit Middlesbrough — the club who had expertly nurtured him — for Manchester City in a £7million deal four years earlier? For at the Etihad, amid the millionaires and the silverware, Johnson may have become a richer man, but he emerged a poorer player. In February of last year, however, and on the eve of a Capital One Cup final against the club at which his career had stalled, Johnson spoke of playing his ‘best ever football’ and wasn’t joking when he revealed summer holiday plans were on hold in the hope of adding to his 12 caps in Brazil. Few argued. But Roy Hodgson was not aboard the ‘Johnson for England’ bandwagon. Johnson scored seven times in seven games during a run last season, and was still an England prospect . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . The call never materialised and Sunderland — beaten by City at Wembley — finished the season fighting relegation, Johnson scoring just one goal in 16 matches as his form dipped. The eulogies which were written in the wake of his joyous January were, on reflection, a little premature. In fact, Johnson’s form has never recovered. Five goals from 31 appearances this season may well make him Sunderland’s top scorer, but that masks what have been subdued and often sluggish performances, even if he remains their likeliest match-winner. It is all a far cry from the skinny teenager who dared to dribble and made others dare to dream of the future which lay ahead. Debuting at 17 for Middlesbrough, he was billed as ‘the next Stewart Downing’. In 2005, that was high praise. He made a mockery of full backs and, indeed, those who had likened him to Downing, for it quickly became apparent that Johnson had the potential to be better than his Boro team-mate. Johnson has made three Premier League appearances under new boss Dick Advocaat (right) Ched Evans: Charged with rape in July 2011 but played for Sheffield United in September. Not released by club until end of the season. Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer: Not suspended by Leeds after charged with grievous bodily harm and affray in 2000. Jody Morris: Leeds suspended him for two weeks after the player arrested in connection with rape charge, October 2003. After six seasons at the Riverside, he was given the platform to prove as much. But at City, like so many young English talents, he regressed. There were concerns from within the club about his dedication and life away from football. His reputation, though, remained intact, such were the fleeting nature of his sightings in sky blue. To the outside observer, he was done an injustice by Roberto Mancini. And so Johnson was forgiven his uninspiring two-and-a-half years in Manchester when he signed for boyhood club Sunderland for £10million in the summer of 2012. Last year, he reflected on his time at City. ‘There is a temptation (to sign for them), of course. The wages, you’re flattered when City are after you, but you’ll go there and be third choice,’ he said. ‘When I was there, I was always the one who would be dropped when the manager rotated the team. I wouldn’t sign for them now if I was a young English player.’ The winger played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . Johnson has scored 20 goals for the Black Cats since signing for the club in 2012 . But perhaps Mancini was sound in his judgment. For although, during three seasons on Wearside, Johnson’s three goals in a trio of victories at North East rivals Newcastle have undoubtedly been the highlight, affording him terrace adulation, Sunderland had expected far more when they laid down an eight-figure sum and wages of £50,000 per week. Now, with Johnson having been charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming, they are facing up to a relegation run-in perhaps without the man in whom they have invested so heavily, should the club decide to suspend him. The future of both Sunderland and their star player hang in the balance. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"Baby Malakai has been alive for seven months and he's never left the hospital. The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not ever be able to walk. Having been diagnosed with a rare medical condition known as Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS), his mother had to give up her job in Perth in order to provide full-time care for her son. Without an income, Stacy Maitai has been forced to survive on welfare funding of $90 a week to support her baby and her seven-year-old daughter. And the 28-year-old is not eligible for further financial assistance from Centrelink as she is not an Australian citizen. Scroll down for video . Baby Malakai (pictured) has been alive for seven months and he's never left the walls of the hospital . Mother Stacy Maitai had to give up her job in Perth in order to care for her son full-time . The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not be able to walk . About 15 to 20 cases of PKS are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia . PKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia. It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects. Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition. 'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way. 'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.' The condition is often undiagnosed during pregnancy and is identified at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complication . Ms Maitai said she was heartbroken when she learnt about her son's condition . A fundraising page was set up to help the struggling family on mycause , so far raising more than $18,000 .

While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai and at home with her seven-year-old daughter Serenity, the financial strain of being without a job and dependent on $90 from welfare is taking its toll. The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 each week. A fundraising page on mycause was set up to help the struggling family, which at the time of publication raised more than $18,000. 'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said. 'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent. 'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes. 'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi. 'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.' Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder. According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide. About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia. 'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states. The condition is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is more commonly discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications. Symptoms include: global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual impairment, seizures, marked hypotonia (floppiness), hearing and/or vision impairment, difficulty in feeding and oesophageal reflux, congenital heart defects, apnoea, prominent high forehead, coarse facial features as child gets older, broad nasal bridge, streaks or patches of lighter or darker skin, sparse hair or bald patches, high arched or cleft palate, shorter arms and legs, disproportionate to the body and extra nipples."
"A Florida university is investigating the death of a student who drowned in Daytona Beach to determine whether or not hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, was reported missing after going swimming with student s at 3am on Sunday and students who were with him said strong currents pulled Parks out to sea. His body was found Monday morning. Students who were with Parks, who were all part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year, said no hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, drowned in Daytona Beach on Sunday after going for a swim with friends at 3am. He was pulled out to see by a strong current and his body was later found on Monday morning . But Bethune-Cookman University is investigating Parks death after university administration 'heard rumors' that hazing was involved. Parks and the men he was swimming with were part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year . A Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Keisha Boyd said that the university administration had 'heard rumors' about hazing and that Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is investigating the student's death, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Parks' mother, Carolyn Parks, said she didn't know why her son would decide to swim in the ocean. 'I don't know why it happened, why he would go into the water like this, because he is not a good swimmer,' she told WESH 2. 'And I had talked to him just before he came out here and he told me he was tired and was going to rest, not knowing he was going to come out here to the beach.' Damian Parks is the second son Carolyn Parks has had to mourn in recent months. Her 16-year-old son died in Miami six months ago. Parks was with four other men in about 5ft of water near Sun Splash Park when he lost grip of a friend's clothing and a the current pulled him out to sea, according to a U.S. Coast Guard report. Parks' friends said that there was 'no foul play at all' and that is was not hazing. They added that the group was 'having fun' and that Parks had not been drinking before the incident . Uamil Turner, who was at the beach, said 'it wasn't hazing', and he was unsure where the rumor came from. Marquise Nelson, who was also at the beach with Parks, said that there 'was no foul play at all'. 'Damian didn't do anything he didn't want to do, and everyone knew that,' Nelson told the News-Journal. 'Everyone was having fun.' Parks friends said that the student had not been drinking the night he drowned nor was he impaired in any way. Deputy Chief Ray Manchester of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said there's no sign of hazing in the incident and that the men had, however, been out bar-hopping before going for a swim. He added that he believed 'they may have been drinking' and that the ocean was rough when the men entered the water. Students and staff at Bethune-Cookman University mourned Parks' death during a prayer vigil held on Monday after the student's body was found . The university said that though the investigation is ongoing, it still wants to celebrate Parks' life and support his family 'in this most difficult time' The university is investigating into hazing, while Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is assisting with toxicology and witness statements, Manchester said. Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Boyd said that though the investigation was ongoing, the university is still celebrating Parks' life. 'Once any additional information is provided by the Beach Patrol, the University will issue another statement. While information regarding the events of April 20th are continuing to surface, we ask that the public join B-CU in supporting the Parks family in this most difficult time,' she said. The university held a prayer vigil on Monday, in which University President Edison Jackson planted a tree in Parks' memory. Students at the vigil said that Parks 'never stopped laughing' and was both talented and artistic. During Monday's vigil, University President Edison planted a tree in Parks' memory. More than 100 people appeared to have shown up for Monday's vigil ."
"Millions of point of sales systems are vulnerable to security breaches as they are protected by the same default password - used by a global maker of payment devices for more than two decades, researches say. The password, 166816, is still being used by about 90 per cent of customers, researchers David Byrne and Charles Henderson disclosed on Wednesday during the annual RSA security conference in California. Henderson said that the unidentified vendor had been using the same default password since at least 1990, according to The Register. Researchers Charles Henderson (right) and David Byrne (left) said a global maker of cash registers has been using the same default password on the payment devices for more than two decades. This potentailly puts the devices at risk of being a target of a security breach . 'Nine out of 10 times when we see equipment from that manufacturer, 90 per cent of the time, this is the password,' he said. 'I actually saw this password really recently on a different manufacturer's device [by a customer] who thought the password was unique to them.' Hackers would need physical access to the payment devices, opening a panel of the device using a paperclip, to exploit it, according to The Register. This type of attack is uncommon and reportedly easy for malicious staff. For example, during the conference it was revealed that two individuals reportedly entered a major American retail store, unscrewed a server rack and walked out with the server leaving the store unable to process credit card payments, according to RT. While Henderson and Byrne did not name the vendor using the 166816 password,  a Google search pointed to Verifone which connects around 27 million payment devices around the world, according to RT. On Thursday, Verifone said in a statement that all of its devices in the field came with the same default password, Z66831, according to CSO. The company also said the password can be found on the Internet with instructions for programming terminals. However, Verifone claimed sensitive payment information or personally identifiable information cannot be captured, even though the password has become known over the years. While Henderson and Byrne did not name the vendor, a Google search pointed to Verifone (file photo of one of the company's payment devices) The company said: 'What the password allows someone to do is to configure some settings on the terminal; all executables have to be file signed, and it is not possible to enter malware just by knowing passwords.' Its new products come with a 'pre-expired' password that has to be changed during installation set up, according to Verifone, and the company also said it encourages customers to change the default password, reported CSO. As retailers have increasingly battled security breaches in recent years, Target was at the center of the second-largest card breach at a U.S. retailer two years ago. An investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70million of Target's customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Hackers are thought to have stolen the credit card details by breaking into Target's computer systems and installing data mining software on credit card machines. The software installed on 40,000 machines across Target's 1,797 stores read the information on a card's magnetic strip - including account number, sort code and CCV code - when it was swiped through the machine. All of the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet, before the theft was discovered after nearly three weeks. In another case of a security breach, in 2014, 56million debit and credit cards are estimated to have been breached in a data theft between April and September at Home Depot stores in the U.S. and Canada."
"A Transportation Security Administration agent who was fired in Nashville after becoming obsessed with a coworker - following her, taking videos and photos and breaking into her house five times - was jailed this week as a result of the stalking case. Daniel Boykin, 33, plead guilty to charges of unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes. In apologizing for his actions in court Thursday, Boykin admitted to repeatedly filming the woman inside a bathroom at Nashville International Airport and was subsequently sentenced to six months prison. At the time of his arrest last year, Boykin was found with 92 videos of the victim — 29 taken from the airport bathroom — and 1,527 photographs. Investigators found additional images taken inside the woman's home of air vents and shelves in the bathroom, which they believe suggested he intended to plant hidden cameras at some point. Obsessed: Daniel Boykin, 33, a former TSA employee, appeared in court in Nashville on Thursday as he was sentenced to six months prison for stalking a colleague. More than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim were discovered on Boykin’s phone and computer, and he broke into her home five times . Disturbed: Boykin was sentenced Thursday for unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes. He will be under strict probation for five years once he leaves prison, however will not be registered as a sex offender . He also took photos of her clothing and stole pictures from her electronic devices. The victim, who has not been named, came forward in May 2014. She told authorities that Boykin would watch her dog on the weekends. However when looking at some photos of the dog on his phone one day at work, the woman discovered a cache of photos of herself. 'I was sick to my stomach,' she told the court, according to WKRN. 'I am sure I was as white as these walls. 'So eventually I said I had a headache and had to go home.' Boykin also took to the stand  to say he was sorry. 'I have abused and broken a trust that I can never repair, and for that I am truly sorry,' he told the court. The detective in the case, Andrew Vallee, said he as truly shocked during the investigation. Arrest: Police began investigating Boykin on May 30, 2014, after the U.S. Attorney's Office forwarded a complaint filed by the victim. She came forward after observing videos of herself on Boykin's phone. He was arrest after a search warrant was served at his Nashville apartment . 'This was one of the worst cases I have seen in terms of invading somebody's privacy in their most intimate moments and the most secure place, her home,' the detective told The Tennessean. 'My biggest disappointment in terms of justice was that under current law, (Boykin) doesn't have to register as a sex offender. 'Because my main motivation for justice is reducing the possibility that he will ever do this again to anyone else.' On top of the six months in prison, the sentence includes more than five years of probation with strict supervision and GPS monitoring. The judge also emphasized that Boykin should continue seeking mental health treatment."
"(CNN)At least 54 people have died and 15 others are missing after a Russian fishing vessel sank off the Kamchatka Peninsula, according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency. More than 60 people were rescued Thursday from the chilly waters in Russia's Far East. The Dalniy Vostok freezer trawler -- a commercial fishing vessel -- was carrying 132 people, the ministry said. Of the people on board, 78 were Russians. The 54 others were foreign nationals from Myanmar, Ukraine, Lithuania and Vanuatu, according to the news agency, with the majority coming from Myanmar. More than 20 fishing vessels are searching for the 15 people still thought to be missing, Tass said. The shipwreck was swift, with the trawler going down in the Sea of Okhotsk within 15 minutes of getting into difficulties, the news agency reported. The most likely cause of the shipwreck was collision with an obstacle which damaged the hull, the official spokesman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, is quoted as saying. The trawler is also thought to have keeled over as a result of hauling some 80 tons of fish on to the deck, the chairman of the emergencies commission in the Kamchatka region, Sergey Khabarov, told Tass."
"(CNN)If you were mourning the loss of a loved one in China, at least the entertainment might have cheered you up. Until now. In rural China, hiring exotic dancers to perform at wakes is an increasingly common practice, but is now the latest focus of the country's crackdown on vice. Strippers are invited to perform at funerals, often at great expense, to attract more mourners, China's official Xinhua news agency said. Another report suggested another motivation: that the performances ""add to the fun."" Photos obtained by CNN from an attendee at a village funeral in Cheng'an County in Hebei Province show mourners of all ages, including children, watching the performance. The attendee, who asked not to be identified, said he was visiting family during the Lunar New Year holiday. While he was there, one of the elderly villagers died so he went to the funeral. ""I felt something wasn't right,"" he told CNN. ""The performance crossed the line. I had heard about hiring strippers to dance at funerals but had never seen it myself. I was shocked when I saw the strippers."" He said the villagers said this kind of performance had been practiced for a while. ""They didn't find it shocking or strange. They were used to it. ""They told me, 'what if we can't watch (this kind of) performance after it gets exposed by the media?'"" In some areas of China, the hiring of professional mourners, known as ""kusangren"" is commonplace. These can include performances, although in recent times the dance acts have increasingly tended towards the erotic. China's Ministry of Culture issued a statement Thursday announcing a crackdown on these funeral stripteases. It said that the ministry had investigated two separate incidents, one in Handan City, Hebei Province, and the other in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province. Both involved multiple-participant ""burlesque"" and ""striptease"" shows as mourners looked on. The Ministry's report said that stripteases undermined ""the cultural value of the entertainment business,"" and asserted that ""such acts were uncivilized."" The practice has been going on for some time, the report said. Exotic dancing and other forms of pornography are illegal in China. The dancers in the two cases were held in ""administrative detention"" following the two investigations, the report added. The Ministry of Culture did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Last year, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security ordered police across China to step up efforts to tackle the ""three vices"" -- prostitution, gambling and drug trafficking -- warning officials they would be held accountable for illegal activities. In February 2014, a massive crackdown on prostitution in the southern manufacturing city of Dongguan, dubbed ""Sin City"" for its huge vice industry, raided 2,000 establishments and detained more than 900 people."
"Sachin Tendulkar has paid tribute to a 'promising' Indian cricketer who has died after colliding with a team-mate while attempting to take a catch during a club match in Kolkata. The Board of Control for Cricket In India confirmed on their official Twitter account that 20-year-old Ankit Keshri had passed away after suffering 'a cardiac arrest following on-field injury'. According to reports, Keshri colleded with a team-mate as they both attempted to take a catch in a senior one-day match match in Kolkata on Friday, and though he regained consciousness afterwards, he died in hospital on Monday. Keshri was only playing as a substitute fielder having been the 12th man. Ankit Keshri had passed away after suffering a cardiac arrest following an on-field injury in Kolkata . Former national team captain Tendulkar, the highest runscorer in Test and one-day international history, was among several India stars to offer their condolences at the news. Tendulkar tweeted: 'Saddened by the demise of Ankit Keshri. A promising career aborted by an unfortunate incident on field. 'May God give strength to Ankit's family and friends to cope with this loss #RIP' Current India batsman Ajinkya Rahane said: 'Very sad to know about Ankit Keshri. Strength to his family and friends. RIP.' Manoj Tiwary, who has played nine ODIs for India, wrote: 'I'm shocked 2 hear d news of Under-19 player from bengal named Ankit kesri's demise due to heart attack. My deepest condolences goes out 2 Ankit kesri's family nd frnds. 'A promising player who scored loads of runs at under 19 level nd he wud hav surely played 4 senior bengal in 2 years time. Rest in peace younger brother.' The 20-year-old died after colliding with a team-mate while attempting to take a catch during a club match . The tragedy comes five months after Australia batsman Phillip Hughes died aged 25 after being hit on the neck by a bouncer in a Sheffield Shield match. Keshri was considered an up-and-coming talent on the Indian cricket scene. The right-hander was captain of the Bengal Under-19 team, and was short-listed for India's under-19 team for the 2014 Colts World Cup. 'It's so unfortunate,' said the Bengal cricket association's Subir Ganguly. 'He was such a promising cricketer and for him to pass away in such a manner is difficult to swallow.' India cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar is among several stars to have given tributes about Keshri ."
"Row: Tinie Tempah pictured performing at an 'intimate gig' in Canterbury last night, where he arrived late and then played just two songs . Fans of rapper Tinie Tempah were left furious when the star turned up hours late to his own 'intimate gig' and only performed two songs before leaving. Music lovers paid nearly £40 to see the singer perform in Canterbury last night - only to wait for more than three hours for him to arrive. He then spent just a few minutes on stage, playing two of his songs before telling the crowd 'See you on tour' and leaving. The club which hosted the event has apologised to the audience and accused Tinie of breaking his contract with them. The event was advertised as 'an exclusive and intimate gig with one of Britain's most talented performers', with tickets starting at £30 plus booking fees. Some fans are believed to have paid more than £100 to meet Tinie, 26, whose real name is Patrick Okogwu and who is best known for his 2010 hit Pass Out. Ticket-holders had been warned that they would not be let in if they arrived after 11pm - even though Tinie was not there until at least three hours later. One member of the audience told MailOnline that she stormed out in disgust when the star failed to turn up until after 2am, and then stayed in a VIP area meeting fans for another hour. 'We were told we needed to be there by 11, but he didn't turn up until well past two,' said the 20-year-old student, who did not want to be named. 'Me and my friend left after three and he still hadn't played. 'We weren't the only people who left early, a lot of people left. People weren't happy.' Fans who stayed for the late-night performance were treated to just two songs before Tinie walked off stage, telling the audience: 'See you on tour.' Venue: Bosses at Club Chemistry said they would seek a refund from Tinie's management . One ticket-holder wrote on Twitter today: 'Clearly success doesn't equal class, Tinie Tempah showed how little he cares about his fans in Canterbury last night.' She added: 'He didn't deliver on his promises to the club, half-heartedly performed two songs rather than a full set then left.' A spokesman for Club Chemistry told MailOnline that Tinie had breached his contract for the event - and claimed that at one point he threatened not to play a single song. 'We have never been so utterly let down or disappointed by someone we were so excited about,' she said. 'There was nothing we could do. At one stage his manager actually told us he was not going to perform at all!' Success: Tinie Tempah pictured in 2011 after winning two Brit awards for his debut album . Organisers apologised to those who had bought tickets, saying in a statement: 'We are as disappointed as you. We were promised a two hour set with DJ Charlesy that included a decent performance from Tinie Tempah, as well as meet, greet and photos. 'It was all a massive let-down. We have lodged a formal complaint with his management and have demanded your ticket money back. 'Club Chemistry is committed to delivering quality artists and entertainment and it would appear that some people are not as dedicated to the cause as we are.' The club said that it would make sure members of the audience are 'compensated' and promised to keep them updated. Representatives for Tinie Tempah failed to return a request for comment on the row."
"Laos is a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful scenery and ornate temples, however not many people venture below the surface and discover that what is underground is perhaps even more spectacular. The wondrous Tham Khoun Ex caves are so exquisite they don't look real at first, which is perhaps why locals believe that spirits inhabit the underground wonderland. Cave photographer, John Spies, 59, captured the sheer magnificence of the vast, yet intricate, underground wonderland. Enormous banks of terraced flowstone decorate the walls of the cave in many places. This slowly growing mound of white and orange calcite is one of the larger deposits along the river passage . Rippling reflections: A blue-tinted glow from outside illuminates the entrance chamber of the cave . Not your usual day out! Floating on clear deep water and reflections near the cave entrance, visitors can either bring their own kayaks or rent boats from the local community to paddle deep inside the cave and marvel at its wonders . Tham Khoun Ex caves, commonly known as Xe Bang Fai River caves, feature imposing stalagmitemade of mineral deposits. With over 15km (nine miles) of awe-inspiring passages and wide expanses of water, it really is one of Laos' hidden treasures. There is even a vibrant forest thriving at the upstream entrance to the caves, the lush green colour contrasting with the  enormous white and orange banks of terraces flowstone that decorates the walls. Visitors are able to kayak through the waters, or explore adjacent chambers on foot. The cave is only able to be safely accessed during the dry season from November to April and during this time the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue. For some of the grander shots, a team of four equipped with powerful LED lights and walkie-talkies helped to light-paint this enormous cavern for this long exposure shot. In 2008, an expedition, co-led by veteran caver John Pollack lead to the mysterious  caves being mapped and photographed for the first time. What the explorers discovered about the little-known cavern was a vast river cave, which means a cavern with an active water source flowing through it. 'Everything about the cave is big-from its towering entrances to its phobia-inducing spiders, which can be 10inches across,' Pollack told National Geographic. Nature at its best! The upstream inflow entrance of Tham Khoun Xe has a verdant forest inside a huge collapsed doline. It is possible to kayak from the resurgence to here and back in one full day . Hidden secrets! Massive formations abound in a newly discovered fossil section of the cave, 50 metres above the river level. This section, encrusted with delicate formations and not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances on . Gigantic! The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 60 metres long and is probably one of the worldís largest rimstone basins . American cave explorer Dave Pierce marvels at giant cave pearls which grow like pearls in an oyster with concentric layers of calcite slowly building up year after year . Lit up! The subterranean passage of the river is spectacularly decorated with calcified formations . Heading into darkness, a visitor paddles a small canoe near the downstream entrance. In the dry season from November to April, the only part of the year safe to visit the cave, the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue . This gigantic section, is also not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances . The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 196 feet long and is probably one of the world's largest rimstone basins. The pool is filled with water during the wet season. The rims of basins like this grow taller each year as calcite precipitates from cave water as it flows faster over protrusions . The immense proportions of Tham Khuon Xe, one of the worldís greatest river caves, are difficult to photograph. A team of four equipped with powerful LED lights and walkie-talkies managed to light-paint this enormous section for this long exposure shot .

"A passenger plane trying to land at a Texas airport turned back when the pilot discovered that the runway lights had been switched off. American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night. The plane left nearly a half-hour late, and when it got to Wichita Falls, the pilot told passengers that the runway lights were turned off and there was nobody at the airport to turn them on, according to officials in the city of 100,000 people. Plane: American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night (file photo) Wichita Falls officials first said that the Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway. Like many other small airports where control towers are not staffed around the clock, pilots in Wichita Falls can operate the runway lights with their radio system. But on Tuesday, city aviation director John Burrus said that Sheppard Air Force Base, which shares the facility, had closed the runway and turned off the lights. Burrus said Sheppard notified pilots of the closure. He added that the American Eagle jet could have landed on an adjacent, 10,000-foot runway that was lit. A spokesman for ExpressJet, a regional carrier that operated the flight under contract with American Airlines, said late Tuesday that the airline was still trying to determine what happened. 'The pilot attempted to activate the lights, but he couldn't do so,' said Jarek Beem, the ExpressJet spokesman. He said he didn't know why the pilot didn't land on the shorter runway. 'We're still reviewing the entire incident.' Beem said the pilot circled Wichita Falls for about 30 minutes before giving up and turning back to DFW. The plane, with 45 passengers, made an otherwise uneventful midnight landing at DFW after a one hour, 40-minute flight, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.

"The age-old ghost town of Balestrino was captured in all its spooky wonder by a drone. Circling the picturesque landscape, the camera picked out the castle on the hill and surrounding depreciated buildings. The ancient Tuscan settlement, based 40 miles south east of Genoa, is shrouded in mystery with its origin and much of its history remaining unknown. Scroll down for video . Little is known about  the origin or history of the ancient Tuscan town that dates back to the 11th century A.D. Residents were forced to flee their homes in the town more than 60 years ago, with seismic instability noted as a main reason for the mass abandonment. A number of historical earthquakes, including one in 1887 that measured 6.7 on the Richter scale, caused severe damage to the settlement’s infrastructure. Dating back to the 11th century A.D., the town was formerly owned by the Benedictine abbey of San Pietro dei Monti in the 1100s. Seismic instability caused by earthquakes forced residents to flee their homes more than 60 years ago . An earthquake in 1887 measured 6.7 on the Richter scale and caused severe damage to the town’s infrastructure . A total of 800 inhabitants occupied the settlement, but by the 19th century most of the population had migrated from the area. A new town with the same name was built around a mile from its location and it 1953 the remaining population moved away from the settlement. Today the town is considered to be the most famous abandoned location in Italy and folklore suggests that the area is haunted.

"This is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a 'no white men' sign showing  their tears dripping into a cup. A picture of Bahar Mustafa, 27, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, pretending to cry was posted online  as she was being accused of discrimination. The handmade poster also refers to a ban on 'cis' or cisgender men, a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match, which is the opposite of transgender. Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry . Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'. She wrote on Facebook last week: ‘Invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you’ve been invited and you’re a man and/or white PLEASE DON’T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.’ Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. Miss Mustafa, 27, added: ‘Don’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do’, followed by a wink. The event’s online page said it was open to ‘self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “woman”.’ A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' Miss Mustafa, pictured at a demonstration, describes herself as a ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’ and previously organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People . The post was met with outrage by students of the university, one of whom described the exclusive policy as 'patronising beyond belief'. The story was covered by student newspaper The Tab just hours after Miss Mustafa first posted the image. Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote ‘zero tolerance’ for ‘all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression’. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students. In the hours after the story made national news yesterday, a friend of Miss Mustafa again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to Facebook. He wrote: 'When you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears'. In February, Miss Mustafa, whose Twitter biography says she is ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’, also organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People. Today her friends posted supportive messages on her Facebook page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it. But not everyone was so supportive. One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best ""them"" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's Welfare and Diversity Officer . Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students but friends have also defended her . She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a £450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. A friend told MailOnline  she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: ‘We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. ‘We have written to the students’ union to express our concern.’ The union said: ‘Goldsmiths Students’ Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. ‘It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. ‘The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control ."
"(CNN)One of the biggest TV events of all time is being reimagined for new audiences. ""Roots,"" the epic miniseries about an African-American slave and his descendants, had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977. Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries. A press release describes the new version as ""original"" and ""contemporary"" and will draw more from Alex Haley's classic novel, ""Roots: The Saga of an American Family."" Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity. ""We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,"" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. ""Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit."" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, ""Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me. Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again, so must we."" The remade ""Roots"" will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation's first African-American president and ""12 Years a Slave"" win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities. ""My career began with 'Roots' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation,"" said Burton. ""There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots' or its importance."""
"Ben Stokes starred with the ball on the first day of England's warm-up match in St Kitts, but it was the runs of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott that pleased him most. England dominated against a modest St Kitts & Nevis XI, dismissing them for a paltry 59 inside 27 overs and then compiling 181 for one in reply. The quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session, though Stokes still impressed with a lively spell that yielded three wickets for 10. Alastair Cook plays behind square on his way to an unbeaten 95 in the tour match against a St Kitts' XI . Cook and teammate Jonathan Trott talk in between overs during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI game . More important for England's Test prospects, though, was the stand of 158 between Cook (95 not out) and Trott (72). Both men needed the comfort of big runs, Cook having been axed from the one-day side on the eve of the World Cup and Trott on his first England appearance since November 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety. He now has the chance to nail down the role of Cook's opening partner and made a solid start in admittedly favourable circumstances. 'Trotty and Cooky gave them nothing and it will stand us in good stead for the Test matches,' said Stokes. Ben Stokes spoke strongly about his team-mates after the two batsmen looked assured at the crease . Stokes had earlier taken three for 10 in an impressive spell with the ball, as England dominated the day . 'The biggest thing for a batsman is time out in the middle. You can do all the training in the nets you want but nothing quite compares to a game and they both did that well today. Trotty has been great, it is almost like he hasn't left. To see him go out and score some runs, the way he has been known to for England over the last five years, was really good to see.' Stokes arguably went over the top in his assessment of Cook's knock, but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores, it could yet prove an important effort. Stokes described his captain Cook as one of the best players in the world after his return to form . 'It was fantastic for Cooky too,' said Stokes. 'He's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world, like he once was, was great. The tempo he played at was fantastic and any bad ball he managed to put it away, which was good to see.' For his part, Stokes looks a certainty to return to the Test side in the Caribbean. Having announced himself as an all-rounder of unusual promise in the 2013-14 Ashes, he saw his glittering rise checked by struggles for form and fitness for long periods last year. He did not even make the cut for the World Cup but now has a chance to prove his credentials once again in the longer form. Trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI England tour match . 'It was nice to make an impact back in the first game, even if it was just a warm-up game in an England shirt,' he said. 'I still had the nerves there and it was pretty pleasing to do well. 'I'm still working very hard on getting back into the team, which is what I want to do. Hopefully that is just the start. 'I need performances to back that up. To keep my place I know I need to keep performing, which is something I haven't been consistent with since Australia so hopefully I get a chance in the Test matches here and I can build on that.'"
"Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame MI5 and the police for radicalising British teenagers who then flee the country to join ISIS. A survey of 1,001 British Muslims found that one in four of this cohort had some sympathy with those who decide to join terror organisations such as ISIS. The figures show that among young and female Muslims, one third have sympathy for the Jihadi runaways despite the deplorable images of ISIS atrocities posted on the internet. Eight per cent agreed they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame the security services for radicalising young Jihadis . Eight per cent of British Muslims said they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John, pictured . Six out of ten strongly condemned those, such as Jihadi John, who have joined ISIS. The survey conducted by Survation on behalf of Sky News found that one-third of all Muslims felt they are viewed with suspicion by non-Muslims. It follows a similar poll earlier this year that found more than a quarter of Muslims sympathised with the Charlie Hebdo attackers, who brutally murdered journalists at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. Yesterday's Survation study of 1,001 non-Muslims, 44 per cent agreed they were more suspicious of Muslims than they had been previously. The pollsters asked Muslims and non-Muslims about whether they felt Islam was 'compatible' with British values and the British way of life. According to the survey, three quarters of Muslims agreed their religion was compatible with the values of British society, with 14 per cent disagreeing. For non-Muslims, less than one quarter viewed Islam as compatible with British values with around half saying the religion was incompatible. One in five followers of Islam believe that British Muslims do not do enough to integrate into society, while 64 per cent believe they do, the pollsters found. Another six per cent felt it was not important for Muslims to fit into British society. Their families: 44% . Government: 15.1% . Religious authorities: 8.8% . Police: 3% . Schools: 2.2% . No-one: 4.6% . Other: 22.1% . 1,001 Muslims polled by Survation for Sky News . The researchers found that one in seven non-Muslims had sympathy for those who have joined ISIS. The researchers found that almost 40 per cent of Muslims agreed that the security services were partly responsible for radicalising young Jihadis, compared with 16 per cent of non-Muslims. Meanwhile more than half of the Muslims surveyed said it was their responsibility to condemn terrorist attacks by Muslims in the name of Islam, while a third said it was not. When it comes to stopping young Muslims joining terrorist groups, 44 per cent felt it was the responsibility of their families to set them straight. More than 15 per cent said it was the government's responsibility, followed by religious authorities (nine per cent), the police (three per cent) and schools (two per cent). The father of one of the three east London schoolgirls who fled to Syria to become 'jihadi brides' blamed the police for failing to keep track of them. Abase Hussen (circled) blamed the police and schools for allowing his daughter to travel to Syria to join ISIS, only for footage to emerge of him at an extremist rally in central London . More than a quarter of Muslims polled in a previous survey said they had sympathy for the Charlie Hebdo attackers . Abase Hussen gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe issued a grovelling apology to the family, only for footage to emerge showing Mr Hussen at an extremist rally in central London. He could be seen standing just feet from one of Lee Rigby's killers while yelling: 'Burn, burn USA.' The survey comes two months after a separate poll found that more than quarter of Muslims said they had sympathy for Charlie Hebdo attackers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who killed 12 on their rampage around Paris. That poll, commissioned by the BBC, also found that 32 per cent of Muslims were 'not surprised' that the massacre took place. And more than 10 per cent of the 1,000 British Muslims interviewed agreed that the magazine 'deserved' to be attacked. The Muslim Council of Britain told the Daily Telegraph: 'For many, current counter-terrorism measures, particularly related to the Prevent strategy, actually lead to greater alienation as Muslims are seen through the lens of security, rather than tackling the scourge of terrorism itself.' The Council said it was pleased that the survey 'once again confirms that Muslims feel British and have a strong affinity with our shared universal values'."
"Joe Root admitted pitches like the one in Grenada make it easier to make centuries and harder to win games, as West Indies batted themselves into a position of relative comfort on day four of the second Test. Regardless of the state of the wicket, Root was in superb touch on his way to 182 not out in the morning session, his second highest score and the fourth of his six hundreds to pass the 150 mark. But for the second match in a row England's hopes of pushing for victory were railroaded by a dead pitch that was arguably better for run-making than on day one. Joe Root hits another ball to the boundary on his way to an impressive big hundred in Grenada . Root admitted that the flat pitch made it too easy to score runs and too tough to take wickets . Root's efforts left the West Indies with a 165-run deficit, but they cleared that to finish 37 ahead on 202 for two at stumps. Speaking after the match, Root lifted the lid on the tourists' frustrations. 'These pitches are great for batters because we get big scores but as far as Test cricket is concerned, it's not ideal,' he said. 'Unfortunately, it's a very unresponsive pitch and it's been hard work . 'We all thought it might break up a little bit more and give a little bit more spin than it has done, but unfortunately it hasn't happened. 'This is what we've got to deal with, and we've just got to get on the best we can.' Stuart Broad, who eventually took the wicket of Darren Bravo, found the going tough in Grenada . Ben Stokes sees the ball disappear to the boundary once again as England struggled on day four . In all likelihood, the destiny of the game will be decided in the morning. England are five overs away from a new ball - which has been the only bankable way of making things happen - and must make it count with a cluster of wickets to set themselves for success. 'We're going to need a very good first hour in the morning,' he said. 'With the new ball we'll need a couple of early wickets and you never know. They're only 40 ahead, so if it's bang bang in the morning we've got a game on our hands. 'That would definitely give us the best chance of winning the game on a very flat wicket. 'Our only chance is wickets with the new ball, whether it be with seam or spin, that's the way it looks at the moment, but you never know.' Root admitted that England need early wickets with the new ball, just as James Anderson achieved on day four . West Indies go in to the final morning with Kraigg Brathwaite on 101 not out having compiled a dogged fourth Test ton and England's tormentor-in-chief Marlon Samuels alongside. Samuels, who memorably saluted Ben Stokes after his dismissal on the third evening, was not sledged when he arrived at the crease but Root had no guarantees that would continue. 'Everyone was very well behaved tonight, there was no-one speaking up,' he added. 'We'll see how tomorrow goes. Concentration might come into it, and maybe a bit of banter could spice things up a bit.'"

'The Secret Service, actually, because they wouldn't let me in the car with her,' Mrs. Obama said in an excerpt of the interview that was released by Ray's program. The full interview is set to air Thursday. Mrs. Obama hasn't driven herself in seven or eight years, she said. She added that driving gives Malia 'a sense of normalcy,' helping her feel like the rest of her friends who are also driving. 'And my kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids.' When Ray says that the Obamas seem 'so grounded,' the first lady replies that her 'hope is just to make sure that they (her daughters) come out of this thing as functioning adults, you know?' Malia also drives herself around Washington, Mrs. Obama said. 'She always has security around but in order for her to learn how to drive she had to drive on her own,' the first lady said during a separate interview on 'Live! With Kelly and Michael' earlier this week. 'So once she was legally permitted to drive on her own, she gets in her car.'

"Students at a school in Memphis were suspended after sharing a mugshot of their teacher on Instagram. Children posted the police picture of eighth grade teacher Tiffany Jackson on social media on Friday, after she was arrested for driving with an invalid licence. When the authorities of Highland Oaks Middle School in Tennessee realised the image had been shared online, they suspended three of the students for three days. Eighth grade teacher Tiffany Jackson was arrested by police for driving while her licence was suspended. Students at the Memphis school where she teaches were suspended after sharing this mugshot online . Parent Shanna Richardson told WMC Action News said her son, who re-posted the picture, was one of the pupils taken out of school for sharing the mugshot. School officials justified suspended the students by saying they had demonstrated an 'inappropriate use of electronic media', but later overturned the decision. Ms Richardson said her son had apologised to the teacher and she thought it was unfair that he had been singled out. 'My son went to her and talked to her to make her feel better, and explained how he deleted it,"" she said. 'He still got punished and that's what makes me upset.' 'It's public information, put it that way. You can see it on social media or you can see it in a magazine,' she added. Officials at Highland Oaks Middle School in Memphis, Tennessee, said the children had demonstrated an 'inappropriate use of electronic media'. but later overturned the suspensions following a backlash . On the 'Cell Phone Policy' listed on the school's website and written by the Shelby County Board of Education, it says the increased use of mobile phones is a 'distraction' to the school environment. It adds: 'These devices are being used by students as a means of cheating on tests, taking inappropriate pictures and video of students and staff for sharing and posting across the internet, threatening and/or bullying other students, and engaging in an excessive amount of social interaction during instructional time.' The policy bans pupils from having a mobile phone on during the school day, and says children who flout the rules will have the devices confiscated. 'Additional consequence' - such as suspension - could follow. It is not known whether the pupils were using their mobile phones in school to post the images. The 'cell phone policy' says the increased use of mobile phones in schools is a 'distraction' to teaching, and could be used to 'take inappropriate pictures and video of students and staff for sharing.. across the internet'"
"(CNN)It wasn't until her 20s that Fethiye Cetin discovered her Armenian ancestry. Her grandmother, 90 years old at the time, told Cetin that her real name was Heranus. Like many other survivors of 1915, Heranus assimilated and kept her identity hidden. Many feared a repeat of the horrors they witnessed and barely escaped. In a crowded reception before a memorial concert in Istanbul this week, people rushed to greet Fethiye Cetin. A strong, soft-spoken woman now in her 60s, Cetin is a prominent lawyer who represented Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink. Dink was a strong proponent of reconciliation between Turks and Armenians who was tried for ""insulting Turkishness."" He was assassinated in 2007. The shocking discovery of her true heritage would change Cetin's life. She tells Heranus' story in an evocative memoir titled ""My Grandmother."" Heranus and her family were among a massive stream of women and children being forcibly marched by Ottoman soldiers, not knowing where they were going or why they were torn away from their male relatives. Echoing throughout the procession were morbid whispers that the men and teenage boys had all been killed. Heranus was 9 at the time. An officer spotted her and her brother and wanted to take them away. Her mother protested but she was told by others, ""The children are dying one by one. No one will make it out alive from this march. If you give them, their lives will be saved."" Heranus and her brother were scooped up onto the officer's horse and taken to a garden packed with other children and fed the first warm meal they had had in days. But soon reality set in and Heranus began to cry and beg to see her mother. Heranus was separated from her brother, adopted by the officer and his wife, who could not have children of their own. Her name was changed to Seher and she was raised Muslim. And so she survived, had children and grandchildren. Cetin was in law school when her grandmother revealed her secret and painful memories of her Armenian roots. It shattered all that she knew to be real. The 1915 forced deportations and massacres were not taught in Turkey's schools. ""There was a huge silence"" Cetin said. ""It was not just the victims that were silent; it was all of society."" Cetin felt rebellion welling up inside her. ""I wanted to go on the streets and scream that they are lying to us,"" she remembers, ""a cruelty like this happened, and I wanted to shout it out loud."" Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have been doing exactly that and demanding that the ""Great Catastrophe"" be recognized as genocide by Turkey and the world. Armenian President Serzh Sargysan said earlier this year that ""impunity paved a path to Holocaust and genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia and Darfur."" The survivors of 1915 and witnesses remember massacres, bloodied rivers, concentration camps, rape and death marches into the Syrian desert. The Republic of Turkey has always rejected the term ""genocide."" Rather, the Ottoman Empire's Committee of Union and Progress believed Armenian nationalists to be collaborating with the Russian army, which was at war with the Ottoman Empire. To prevent this alliance and stop violence against civilians, the committee undertook a policy of ""relocation"" to move Armenian populations residing in or near the war zone to southern provinces. Turkey argues that wartime conditions, famine and internal conflicts led to the death of millions of Ottomans, including Armenian subjects. But it's only in the last decade that public dialogue in Turkey began. ""We just started breaking the silence recently"", Cetin said. ""People were quiet for 90 years in this country."" Turkish leaders have recently taken a more reconciliatory tone. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered Turkey's condolences last year to the descendants of the Armenians who lost their lives. He called for the establishment of a joint historical commission in order to study the ""events"" of 1915. But Pope Francis' use of the word ""genocide"" and the European Parliament's resolution last week angered Turkish leaders. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the resolution ""selective and one-sided,"" claiming it repeated ""anti-Turkish clichés."" Erdogan deemed it a ""hostile campaign against Turkey."" This week, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu repeated the call for a historical inquiry and the need for an approach based on ""just memory"" for a ""common peaceful future."" He asked that third parties, such as Pope Francis, refrain from ""aggravating age-old wounds."" A century on, Cetin says the dynamism surrounding the 100th anniversary excites her, bringing together artists, musicians, scholars and intellectuals as well as Turkey's citizens of all ethnicities and Armenians from across the world. If the government were to acknowledge 1915 as a genocide, it would speed up the reconciliation and healing process, she says. ""But if it does not face genocide, then it does not matter. Society coming face to face with it is more important."" Still Cetin remains hopeful that Turkey will accept its moral obligation towards history and its people. As an Armenian Turk, Cetin has helped others retrace their roots and look for long lost answers. But for many, the emotional journey remains unfulfilled as long as Turkey denies the cause of their pain."
"Hull midfielder David Meyler says he is totally convinced the Tigers will hang on to their Premier League status. Steve Bruce's side are in 15th place, three points off the relegation zone, but have a tough run-in with five of their last eight matches against clubs in the top seven of the Premier League. The Tigers have impressed however against top sides, drawing 1-1 away at Manchester City and losing 3-2 at the hands of Chelsea in a match they could easily have won. Hull midfielder David Meyler is confident his side will remain in the top flight despite their recent poor form . The Tigers will be hoping to bounce back from their 3-2 home defeat by Chelsea when they face Swansea . Hull are currently just three points above Burnley . Speaking ahead of the weekend meeting with Swansea, Meyler said: 'We are not going down. We just have to get into the mentality that it is not good enough to accept the 3-2 defeat by Chelsea, even if they are likely Premier League champions. 'We had some great chances and we need to win these games when you get into those positions.' He added: 'We're down to the last eight games now and this is where we have to earn our money. 'This is the period when everything will be decided so we've got eight games to make sure we finish as well as we can and that is what we aim to do. 'We finished 17th last season and at the moment, we're 15th this season so we're a little bit ahead. Hull trio Mohamed Diame (pictured), James Chester and Gaston Ramirez could feature against Swansea . 'What we want to do here is maintain Premier League status for a number of years to come and we'll do what we have to do to achieve that aim and build this club. We're looking to develop every year. 'We've got eight games to come, against some decent teams, but I'm sure we can get the wins we need if we keep performing like we did in games against the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool and for 70 minutes against Chelsea. 'It will be tough against Swansea but we're going there with the mentality that we can get some points.' Hull will be hugely boosted by the return of Senegal midfielder Mohamed Diame after a long injury absence, and James Chester is also back in the squad to face Swansea. Gaston Ramirez is fit to play despite concerns about an injury picked up on international duty."
"(CNN)The U.N. Security Council voted Tuesday in favor of an arms embargo on Houthis -- the minority group that has taken over large swaths of Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa -- and supporters of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The resolution ""raises the cost"" for the Houthis, according to Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations. In addition to the arms embargo, it also demands that the Shiite group pull back and refrain from more violence and includes sanctions aimed at controlling the spread of terrorism, according to Grant. Russia abstained from Tuesday's vote, saying it didn't like the inclusion of sanctions. In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has led a coalition that is conducting airstrikes on targets associated with Saleh's supporters and the Houthis, who have emerged as Yemen's most dominant force in recent months. Also Tuesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Saudi Arabian Minister of Defense Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz agreed to form a joint military commission to discuss the implementation of a major strategic maneuver inside Saudi Arabia, Egypt's state-run Ahram news agency reported. Egypt announced that it would dispatch several naval ships to help halt the rebels' advance. In response to media reports, Egyptian officials said no troops have yet been sent to Yemen. The Houthis forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, though Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to Yemen. Those allied with Hadi have accused the Iranian government of supporting the Houthis in their uprising in Yemen. They include Yemen's current ambassador to the United Nations, Khaled Mahfoodh Abdulla Bahah, who said Tuesday, ""We refuse (the) influence of Iran in Yemen affairs."" CNN's Richard Roth and Dominique Dodley reported from New York, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report."
"Sometimes strong-willed children can prove a challenge to parents, especially when it comes to doing what they're told. And that's certainly the case in one household, as a new video shows. Little Catalina from America was filmed emptying out the contents of the kitchen cabinets at home. But when her father tells her to clean up her mess, she vehemently refuses with a heated - and rather cute - argument ensuing. Standing in a frilly skirt with her arms crossed, Catalina answers back at her father in a bid to get him to do the cleaning. 'I already cleaned the kitchen, no it's your turn, I'm not picking up your mess,' her elder firmly responds. As the argument goes on, the volume gets higher and higher. At one point Catalina hits her father's leg in frustration. Caught red-handed: Little Catalina from America was filmed emptying out the contents of the kitchen cupboards at home . Pointing the finger: But when her father tells her to clean up her mess, she vehemently refuses with a heated - and rather cute - argument ensuing . The two then point back and forth at each other as the debate continues. Showing her cheeky side, Catalina  proceeds to pick up a couple of pans and march forwards with them before dumping them down and standing again with her arms crossed. 'No I'm not doing it... you put them away,' her father says, quickly latching on to her antics. At the end of the video Catalina's father walks off, leaving her alone to figure out what to do with the kitchen implements. A woman filming the scene can be heard letting out a soft giggle after watching the boisterous toddler in action."
"(CNN)Pope Francis will visit Cuba on his way to the United States in September, the Vatican said Wednesday -- a trip that will come months after he helped negotiate a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The exact timing of the Cuba trip wasn't immediately released, but the Vatican said the Pope would stop in Cuba before his planned late September stops in Washington, New York and Philadelphia. In Havana's Cathedral Square, people reacted joyously to the news. ""The Pope coming here, maybe he could ... make more positive ways for Cubans to go towards religion, more than politics,"" said Raul Garcia, a Cuban-American who returned to the island. ""I think it's going to be a very good visit, very beneficial for the country."" ""We are waiting for him. We're very happy he is coming,"" said Ulises, a man who sells brightly colored paintings of antique cars to tourists on the street next to the sprawling Havana Cathedral. ""He should come and get to know it and walk around the pretty spots in Havana."" Cuba's state-run television reported that Francis would visit, but like the Vatican did not report exactly when he would arrive. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, played a role in restarting diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, earning praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. The Pope made personal pleas to Obama and Cuban leaders in private letters, writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction. The Vatican also hosted talks between U.S. and Cuban delegations in October, where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross, who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries. ""I want to thank His Holiness, Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,"" Obama said in December as he announced a U.S. policy shift on Cuba. Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has displayed a deep interest in international affairs. He repeatedly urged Western leaders not to bomb Syria, hosted a prayer service between Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the Vatican and waded into diplomatic controversy last week by referring to the killing of 1.5 million Armenians a century ago as a ""genocide."" The latter move deeply upset Turkish leaders, who recalled their Vatican ambassador. The Pope is expected to continue his international activism in July with a trip to South America, where he will visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. In late September, Francis will visit Washington, where he will address Congress; New York, where he will address the U.N. General Assembly; and Philadelphia, where he will celebrate a public Mass that's expected to draw more than 1 million people. Francis will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012. Church officials in Havana said that they expect Francis' visit to be shorter than those of his predecessors. Officials from the Vatican are expected to travel to the island soon to finalize logistics for Francis' trip, the officials said . CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Havana. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report from Rome."
"While sunseekers across Britain have been making the most of the clear skies recently to soak up some sunshine, the lack of clouds has also proved a bonus for stargazers in Scotland hoping to catch sight of shooting stars. This incredible image was captured above Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer Graeme Whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the Lyrid meteor shower. The annual celestial event has been observed for the last 2,700 years across the globe, but is most visible in the northern hemisphere, and is expected to peak tonight with between 10 and 20 meteors an hour. Scroll down for video . Close up: A magnified version of the image above shows one meteor appearing to graze the horizon, while another meteor trail appears top left . Stunning: Graeme Whipps captured this image of the Lyrid meteor shower in the skies above Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire yesterday . The strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour, but in 1982 Americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour. The Lyrids are created by debris from comet Thatcher, which takes about 415 years to orbit around the Sun, and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as Vega and the constellation Lyra in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name. Mr Whipps, a 50-year-old meteorologist, said: 'I was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor, which was amazing.' While the Lyrid shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour, most years the peak, which occurs tonight, only produces between five and 20 per hour (the Lyrid shower pictured from space)"
"I hope when you were sitting at home in front of your tellies  looking forward to the latest instalment of the Arsene vs Jose show that you remembered all important thing: this classic managerial match-up is no capital club sprint, it’s a London derby marathon. And yes, it might well have been entertaining to see the pair - one dressed as a clown, say, and the other a superhero - having it out on the streets while Crammy and Brendan told us some fascinating facts about historical landmarks. Perhaps they can do that next year? This year, instead, once the actual race was run, all roads led to the Emirates and a Sky Sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon. Arsene Wenger has a look in the direction of Jose Mourinho during the stalemate at the Emirates . And, yes, of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on. One with the added factor of Cesc Fabregas happening to be the man in the middle, on a couple of levels. But surely there was never any doubt which two men were going to set the tone for what was about to come. Having just made it sound like some kind of Premier League Mayweather vs Pacquiao match up, in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews. Jose was nigh on glowing about Arsenal’s ‘creative team (with) amazing, fantastic solutions.’ While Arsene said one of the important motivators for his team was ‘to share positive emotions with our fans.’ It sounded like someone had just broken out the joss sticks in the tunnel. Perhaps a little more in-your-face were the pundits in the booth. Here Thierry ‘as an Arsenal man’ Henry found himself getting mildly bad cop/bad copped by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness over the former Gunners striker’s contention that ‘it was kind of weird to see (Cesc Fabregas) in a blue shirt’ and that ‘if I was the boss I would tried to buy him back.’ But this really was just everyone jostling for position at the starting gun. The race was yet to be run. In the first half of the encounter, it was the penalty shouts that saw the director scrambling, to switch to Gaffercam. The first image was a beauty, capturing both men together on the touchline after Oscar and Ospina had collided. Oscar and David Ospina collided with the Chelsea man taken to hospital for a suspected concussion . In the foreground, Mourinho dispensed with the pre-game purple prose and was using an entirely different vocabulary to berate the fourth official. While in the distance, Wenger looked on with the benign countenance of a man who perhaps thought he’d got away with one? Each was then given their own live hero shot. Jose was simply stoney-faced for his, by the time the camera had found him after the Fabregas yellow for an adjudged dive. But Arsene’s solo was much more dramatic. A handball shout against Cahill rejected, the Arsenal boss had by now donned one of his famous zip up coats and was captured in glorious slo-mo. His arms raised in the natural position for a man exclaiming ‘how wasn’t that a handball?’ Back in the studio at half time, Thierry looked just as surprised as his old boss had, as he exclaimed ‘Two? Wow!’ when Jamie Carragher said he thought Chelsea had a pair of good shouts from twelve yards. However, not for the first or last time he revealed his true colours when he admitted he thought there had indeed been one for the west London team. ‘I was showing my Arsenal side earlier’, Henry confessed. In his case, proverbially holding his hands up in the box. Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness chew the fat after the final whistle . Into the second half, and on co-commentary Alan Smith made the point very early that Arsenal would be happy ‘in their quest to finish second’. And it became pretty clear pretty quickly that there were in fact two teams out there who’d take one point each. All of which meant the spotlights reserved for any Arsene and Jose fireworks were left dimmed throughout. We didn’t even get any awkward gaffer-on-gaffer action at the final whistle. Instead, just the sight of Mourinho disappearing down the tunnel with the draw tucked away inside his voluminous coat. And John Terry securing the right to be last image in the show with his enthusiastic shadow-boxing celebration. Indeed, by the time Sky had tracked down both managers back in the tunnel, it had reverted to the pre-game chill out zone they had created before kick off. Reporter Patrick Davidson’s attempt to get the Chelsea manager to bite only proved that Jose just wasn’t that hungry. ‘I have no comment’, he continued to reply, his face impassive throughout. Instead, we got a maths lecture on the points position at the top of the table. And a description of John Terry’s performance as ‘from the moon.’ Mourinho patrols the touchline as the Chelsea boss saw his side take another step toward the title . Someone had clearly relit those joss sticks, because Arsene too failed to take the bait when his head to head to Jose was broached. ‘It’s not about me, it’s about my team and my club’, he smiled, before deftly acknowledging an excellent Chelsea side without also paying dues to his opposite number. So in the end, both men effectively breasted the tape together (although they weren’t exactly holding hands in the process), finishing equal first in this particular one. Something Sky Sports spotted early on was the deal, and very wisely chose not to try too hard to shoehorn in melodrama where none existed. And why should they? After all, everyone will be back next year for more of the same. So what’s the rush?"
"The Red Wings' Drew Miller says he's eager to hit the ice again just a day after receiving a cut that could have cost him his eyesight. 'I feel very blessed the skate didn't hit my eye,' Miller said at practice on Wednesday. 'Very lucky' Skating with a full face mask during practice, the Detroit forward openly bore a gruesome red wound that required 50 to 60 stitches to close along multiple layers of skin, the Detroit Free Press reports. Gruesome: Miller was left with a scar across his eye, but reportedly didn't suffer any damage to his eyesight after another player cut him across his face . The incident occurred shortly after a faceoff during the first period of Tuesday's game between the Red Wings and the Senators. While battling for the puck, Ottawa's Mark Stone lost his balance and lifted his right skate backwards in an arc, catching Miller just under his visor. Stone's skate cut Miller along his right cheek and again just below his eyebrow. Miller exited the ice under his own power before medical staff rushed him to receive treatment, including stitches. Though he has a gash that runs across both sides of his eyelid and bruising below his right eye, Miller said his vision was largely unaffected. 'Right now, it's just dealing with the cut and the stitches and the soreness,' Miller explained. 'Other than that, my eye is good, and when I got on the ice today, I felt pretty good.' Freak accident: While falling to the ice, Ottawa's Mark Stone lifted his skate and struck Miller under the visor with the blade . Stitched up: Twitter user Red Wing Memes published a photo of the Red Wings forward with the freshly stitched wound . Second opinion: A second angle showed Stone losing his balance while fighting for the puck with the Red Wings' Luke Glendening . Bruiser: Miller said he wanted to come back for the third period after being stitched up, though the team said he will likely return Thursday against Boston . My Fox Detroit reports Miller had wanted to return during the third period of the game, which Detroit lost 2-1. Red Wings Coach Mike Babcock said Miller will likely have a 'big-time scar' but to expect the winger to be on the ice Thursday. The team will need Miller, who has played in 159 straight games, as it tries to secure the final guaranteed playoff spot in the Atlantic division."

Spain international Isco has featured heavily for the Spanish giants this season in a predominately attacking role but Ancelotti is confident that Real's No 23 could sit in front of the defence just like Modric usually does. 'We are missing some important players but it's impossible for us to be more motivated than we are. We have to live with injuries. We did it in the past and it will not hurt our confidence,' Ancelotti said at a press conference. Real Madrid boss Ancelotti could turn to striker Javier Hernandez in their absence against Atletico Madrid . Isco and Jese will also be be hoping to start the Champions League clash against their Madrid rivals . Real Madrid will be without former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Modric for their Champions League clash . Ancelotti's Real Madrid side will also have to do without attacking duo Bale and Benzema against Atletico . 'Isco has played in Modric's position before and he did very well there. We have plenty of options even without Bale and Benzema. There's James, Jese and Chicharito. James has been doing great, both on the right and in midfield. Chicharito is in fine shape as well, both physically and mentally. 'I will choose the best possible line-up. I will select players that will help the team to play like we did in the first leg. I have the best squad in the world in my opinion.'"
"Santiago Vergini has indicated he may be ready to extend his stay at Sunderland after revealing Premier League survival could trigger the offer of a two-year permanent contract. The 26-year-old Argentinian returned to the Stadium of Light on a season-long loan deal from Costa Rican side Sport Uruguay de Coronado in August last year and has made 35 appearances to date this season. The last of them was a start in Sunday's 1-0 derby victory over Newcastle which provided a huge boost to the club's top-flight survival hopes. Santiago Vergini (left) is keen to stay at Sunderland having played a key role in the Wearside outfit's 1-0 derby win over Newcastle United on Sunday. Above, the Sunderland defender battles with Ayoze Perez for the ball . Vergini celebrates with team-mate Costel Pantilimon at the full-time whistle following the Wear-Tyne derby win . A successful completion of new head coach Dick Advocaat's mission to keep the Black Cats in the Premier League could have significant consequences for Vergini, and he is open to what might come his way. He told the Sunderland Echo: 'In the contract, it is written that if we stay in the Premier League, I can stay here for another two years. I feel very comfortable here, both at the club and outside the club, so I would be very keen to stay. 'The only downside is the climate and the weather, but even that has been good for the last few days! 'It has been very good to play regularly [this season] and I am very happy. I think with time, I have been able to adapt more to the style of play and also to my team-mates. Vergini helped Sunderland keep a clean sheet in the derby win as he makes a slide tackle on Perez . Sunderland initially signed Vergini on loan in January 2014, with the defender making his debut in an FA Cup fourth round clash with Kidderminster where he makes an attempt to tackle Jack Bryne . 'Apart from the struggles we are going through in the league, I have felt very comfortable.' Victory over the Magpies - their first in nine games in all competitions - eased Sunderland into 15th place and three points clear of the relegation zone. However, that could count for little if Advocaat's men fail to build upon it when Crystal Palace head north on Saturday. Vergini said: 'Every win brings with it a lot of confidence and with a derby game, that is even more the case. In our next game, we need to show the same character and the same spirit as we did on Sunday.'"
"Police in Florida are investigating a possible road rage incident after a woman filmed a man throwing a bottle of liquid at her vehicle while driving his van. Michelle, a 32-year-old mother who has asked for her surname not to be used, said the white van drove through a red light at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday and almost hit her vehicle. She said she followed the man and taped him after he swerved in and out of traffic while speeding on a stretch of road that has two school crossings. Scroll down for video . Cell phone footage recorded by a mom in Jacksonville, Florida, on Tuesday shows a 28-year-old man, Dan Frank, throw a bottle of liquid at her vehicle while he was driving his van . When she pulled up next to the man, he threw the bottle at her car, she told Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Further down the road, she said, the driver got out of his van in traffic and made rude hand gestures at her. Michelle said she followed him to his nearby home, where he ran inside before coming outside again to confront her. 'I didn't know if he stashed something or was returning with a weapon,' Michelle told ActionNewsJax. She left at that point and met with police at another location. Police have identified the driver as Daniel Robert Frank, 28, who was arrested earlier this month for an unrelated offence. Frank is helping police who are investigating the case as misdemeanor criminal mischief and his attorney says there is more to the case than simply the video footage. A woman named Michelle, right, told police that the white van drove through a red light at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday and almost hit her vehicle . 'We feel that Mr. Frank was the victim here and things spiraled out of control,' Lewis Fusco told ActionNewsJax. Fusco said his client went through a yellow light, and that the trailer he was hauling could have crossed the line when the light turned red. 'She then threw some kind of a large object at his front window that put a crack in my client's window,' said Fusco. 'At that point, that's when he became angry and did something that he is not proud of and retaliated as shown in the video.' Frank refused to an on-camera interview, but showed local reporters a dent on the hood and small cracks in the windshield of his vehicle. According to his attorney, Frank had a passenger in the van with him during this attack who has made a written statement corroborating his claims."
"Perhaps it was the excitement of the Grand National, but this horse fell at the first hurdle after wandering into thick mud. It was hardly Becher's Brook - one of Aintree's most notorious fences - but Cody somehow found himself stuck in the bog in Belvedere, south-east London. Crew members climbed into the watery ditch as they tried to ease the distressed animal to safety on Friday afternoon. Sticky situation: Animal rescue experts spent more than an hour rescuing Cody after he wandered into a bog . Cody was covered head to hoof in mud after being dragged to safety, but - despite being shaken by the ordeal - was otherwise unharmed. Borough Commander for Bexley Richard Welch said crews worked hard to save the horse. He added: 'One thing is certain that it won’t be running in the Grand National tomorrow.' Falling at the first hurdle: Cody got stuck in the mud after wandering into a bog in Belvedere south-east London . 'Cody has been taken back to the stables to be seen by a vet.' Fire crews were dispatched to save him from his ordeal shortly before 1.30pm and worked for an hour and a half before freeing him at 2.55pm."
"In one of the classic games of their long and illustrious rivalry, the first meeting of the season between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees lasted nearly seven hours - becoming the longest game in team history for both. Boston took a 6-5 lead in the 19th inning on Saturday morning on a sacrifice fly by Mookie Betts. Xander Bogaerts scored after reaching on his fourth hit of extra innings. Chase Headley and Mark Teixeira hit tying home runs for the Yankees in a game interrupted by a power outage for 16 minutes in the 12th.

Fans hold up their cell phones after a bank of lights went out in the 12 inning during the game causing a 16-minute delay . David Ortiz hit a solo homer for Boston to break a three-all deadlock in the 16th inning. But then Teixeira, who turned 35 on Saturday, batting from the right side against right-handed knuckleballer Steven Wright, led off the bottom half with a no-doubt drive to left field. Pablo Sandoval put the Red Sox back in front with an RBI single in the 18th only to see Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran hit doubles in the bottom half to tie it again at five. The longest game in the history for both teams and the new Yankee Stadium, which opened in 2009, pushed past 2am on the East Coast. Alex Rodriguez (13) reacts after he struck out in the first inning against the Boston Red Sox. The game pushed past 2am on Saturday on the East Coast . Dustin Pedroia (15) of the Boston Red Sox is congratulated by teammates in the dugout after he scored in the first inning against theYankees . The game between the Yankees and Red Sox lasted nearly seven hours (Yankees pitcher Nathan Eovaldi during the game) The teams get little chance to rest, too as they are back at it for the middle game of the series Saturday at 1.05pm. Each club went to its final reliever in the 15th during the longest game for the Yankees by innings since a 19-inning victory over Minnesota in August 1976. The longest game between the teams was a 20-inning win by Boston in the second game of a 1967 doubleheader. Headley's solo shot off fill-in closer Edward Mujica came with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Neither team could break through again until Ortiz launched an 0-2 pitch from Esmil Rogers to right-center. It was the slugger's first home run of the year and his 50th against the Yankees, including playoff games. Rogers threw 35 pitches the previous night, too. Didi Gregorius had a chance to win it for New York in the 16th and 18th, but grounded out with a runner at third to end both innings."
"River Plate are keen to sign Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao but admit a deal is complicated. The Colombia forward spent eight years with the Argentine side before leaving for Porto in 2009 and River Plate are open to Falcao returning. During an interview with Esto es River program, vice president Matias Patanian said: 'We dream of Falcao Garcia. The doors are open.' River Plate are keen to sign former forward Radamel Falcao who has struggled on loan at Manchester United . River Plate vice president Matias Patanian admits the club 'dream of Falcao' and that 'the doors are open' The 29-year-old has struggled during a season-long loan spell at Old Trafford this term - scoring just four Premier League goals - and it remains to be seen whether United will exercise the option to keep the frontman or whether he will return to parent club Monaco. However, Falcao has been in good goalscoring form for his countrythis week, finding the net three times in two games to equal Colombia’s all-time goalscoring record with 24 goals. Joining River Plate at the age of 15 in 2001 before making his first-team debut four years later, Falcao went on to score 34 goals in 90 appearances for the Primera Division club. Falcao scored 34 goals in 90 appearances for the Argentine club during his four seasons in the first team ."
"He was the goalkeeper who only won his place in the side on the back of a teammate shipping an embarrassing eight, so when Costel Pantilimon conceded four goals inside 45 minutes he feared the worst – for himself and the club’s top-flight status. That was four weeks ago when Aston Villa ran riot at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland were booed from the field at half-time before thousands of fans streamed for the exits. Within 48 hours Gus Poyet had been sacked and Dick Advocaat was being installed. The Dutch boss celebrated his first home match with a 1-0 victory over Newcastle last weekend, a result which moved the Black Cats three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of this afternoon’s visit of Crystal Palace. Sunderland Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon celebrates Jermain Defoe's goal against Newcastle United . Pantilimon kept his place despite pressure from Vito Mannone - the man who was dropped in the wake of October’s 8-0 defeat at Southampton – and the Romanian stopper admits there has been a definite mood change under Advocaat. ‘Before the new manager came, our confidence was not in a good way,’ said the 28-year-old, who was a Premier League winner with Manchester City in 2012 and again last season. ‘We were playing very badly, but now we have a new motivation. He’s brought the enjoyment back. ‘I never expected to play in a game like the 4-0 loss at home to Aston Villa. I was upset. You start to think about what you did wrong. The former Manchester City goalkeeper celebrates with teammate Santiago Vergini at the Stadium of Light . ‘We had to change something. It wasn’t easy. I thought about relegation after the Villa game. ‘I was asking myself, “What is happening?”. We couldn’t win games at home. Away from home we were taking points, but in front of our fans we were failing. 'It was strange and very frustrating. I didn’t know what we could do to be better.’ The answer, it appears, was Advocaat. ‘He has tried to bring us together as a group,’ explained Pantilimon, who has so far avoided one of Advocaat’s infamous fines for a lack of punctuality. ‘We all eat lunch together as a team. That should be normal. It’s a good idea, it creates a stronger group. It means we get to know each other better and other people’s situations. Pantilimon rolls the ball out to a defender as Sunderland beat Newcastle at the Stadium of Light . ‘On the pitch, he wants us to be aggressive all the time, but also keep the ball a lot more. ‘Before the derby he reminded us that not many people have the opportunity to play in a game like this. I think these words said everything, the motivation was at 100 per cent. ‘The atmosphere last week reminded me a lot of how it was after City won the league (in 2012). ‘It was incredible. My wife and my parents were there and they loved the game.’ Both of Pantilimon’s parents are deaf and the keeper uses sign language to communicate. Indeed, it was some advice from his father which set him on his way to a career between the posts. The Romanian shot-stopper celebrates a Sunderland win with his team-mates against Newcastle . ‘I was a striker when I started playing as a child because I liked scoring goals,’ said 6ft 8ins Pantilimon, who was raised in Bacau at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. ‘My father told me it was better to go in goal. He said I had the physical attributes to play there. ‘But I was not always so tall. I had a period between 14 and 16 when I grew so fast. ‘Thankfully, I didn’t like basketball so much. When I was about 15 I realised I could be a professional goalkeeper. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat enjoyed his first victory as manager in the derby game with Newcastle . ‘I was only 16 when I made my debut for a professional club. It was a third division club, but it was young to make my debut at that level. ‘I was always confident I could be a goalkeeper. I thought I could get right to the top, I’ve worked hard to be here and I don’t want to stop, I want to get better and better.’ Under Advocaat, things are certainly looking up, for Pantilimon and Sunderland."
"Beach-goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at Victoria's picturesque Rye Beach last week - a swimming echidna! The prickly Australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the Mornington Peninsula, 83 km south of Melbourne. Where it was heading, is anyone's guess. Scroll down for video . This echidna was spotted paddling out to sea off Rye Beach, a popular surfing and fishing spot on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula . The video of the swimming echidna, which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel, was posted online by YouTube user Emma B. According to Australia Zoo, echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers. They like the water so much, that the Zoo built a special  swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days. Echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean . The echidna - or spiny ant-eater - is  found all over Australia, in coastal forests, alpine meadows and desert habitats. They live on a diet of ants, termites, grubs and worms but biologists think the mammals evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus. Gary Sutton, a park ranger from Narawntapu National Park in Tasmania, said he has also seen  wallabies and wombats surfing. He previously told the ABC he thought the animals went in the water to get rid of parasites, like lice and ticks. With its webbed-feet and snout in the air as a snorkle, the little echidna paddled out to sea ."
"It's not something parking wardens are usually accused of... but some have been criticised for being too nice. An inspection in two Welsh towns found officers there were reluctant to issue tickets, letting many locals get away with parking offences. And their lax approach meant that parking in the evenings and at weekends had become a ‘free for all’. Inspectors in Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells have been accused of being too lax when it comes to giving out parking tickets for infringements (file picture) The investigation was carried out by officials from Powys County Council, who could not understand why the council was losing money on enforcing parking restrictions. Powys council needs to issue 40 per cent more tickets just to break even. Councillors shadowed wardens three times in the towns of Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells and found there were plenty of infringements, but many were going unticketed. In one case, a driver had already overrun their allotted time by 15 minutes, but the warden ‘still appeared to be reluctant to issue the ticket’. Officials also often did not penalise tradesmen for parking in restricted areas – even though only water and electricity vehicles are allowed to stop in them without permits. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’. Even when tickets were issued, 39 per cent were cancelled at the first challenge. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’ (file picture) The investigators suggested a range of actions to toughen up the operation, including shortening the grace period drivers are given after their time runs out before a ticket is issued. They said wardens are currently leaving it ‘too long’, particularly since the process to issue a ticket itself takes seven minutes and can be aborted at any time. They also said ticketing policies need to be more consistent across Powys as ‘decisions are made locally and sometimes contrary to police recommendations’. Some 5,000 tickets are issued in Powys, bringing in £1.2million a year, but the council is still subsidising the operation. The report said 7,000 tickets would need to be issued to make the service ‘cost neutral’."
"They’ve won seven on the spin in the Premier League and made Liverpool look like relegation candidates as opposed to Champions League rivals during Saturday’s first-half slaughter. So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a ‘no contest’. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack – and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year’s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger’s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they’re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger’s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere. Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply."
"Overcoming terminal cancer through healthy eating - that statement in print appears dubious at best. But it becomes completely believable when it is brought to life through the inspirational, optimistic, comeback story of a charismatic, beautiful, young woman named Belle Gibson. Belle cast a spell through her endearing vulnerability and charming personality, collecting an enormous social media following who were enamoured with her brave account of reclaiming her health. Wellness warrior Belle Gibson has admitted that she never had cancer and does not want forgiveness . Now that Belle has admitted she made her story up, we ask ourselves, how could we have fallen so hard for an account of what many have called a medical miracle, without a shred of supporting evidence? The answer is very simple. We wanted to believe. And we did not so much believe in Belle´s story, as we believed in Belle. Everyone loves a heart-warming account of overcoming the odds. We were enchanted by Belle´s journey, as well as by Belle herself. A beautiful, young, inspirational woman, we fell in love with her story as well as with her—which caused us even to downplay the rumours and suspicions of sceptics within the medical community as the fabric of her brave fight against cancer began to unravel. Here are five ways that the Belle´s of the world win us over. She founded the Whole Pantry - a book and app which over 300,000 people have downloaded . Appearances are Reality—and Seeing is Believing . Believe it or not, studies show that people cannot distinguish between behaviour that is honest and behaviour that is deceptive. This causes us to make the easier judgement—that other people are truthful. To make matters worse, when we like someone, we are likely to believe they are truthful, even when they are lying. How do we overcome the truthfulness bias? One way is to closely examine a person´s motives. When someone relays a heart-warming story, as Belle did, what is she getting out of it? While many people do not want to spoil a happy ending with a cloud of suspicion, examining prospective outcomes for the storyteller often raises suspicions about potential ulterior motives that might otherwise never come to light. Wendy L. Patrick PhD says we fell for Belle Gibson because 'we love heartwarming stories—especially comeback stories' Born to Bond - There is a Bit of Belle in All of Us . We love heart-warming stories—especially comeback stories. Especially when we feel an affinity to the heroine. We were Belle´s cheerleaders as she recounted her fight against cancer—using a weapon we all have at our disposal: healthy eating. Every one of us could be Belle in the future, because cancer strikes without warning. We loved walking along side her in her journey, recognizing there is a bit of Belle in all of us. We identified with her vulnerability, celebrated her success in regaining her health, and felt empowered by the recognition that although we each face different hurdles, if she could beat the odds, so can we. 'We loved walking along side her in her journey, recognizing there is a bit of Belle in all of us' Credibility Clouds Perception: Failing to Heed Belle´s Alarm Bells . Credible people are welcome sources of security. We feel comfortable following their lead, and taking their advice. Belle released a whole foods recipe book and top-rating food app, which thousands of people bought. Why? Because she was a certified nutritionist? Because the medical community validated her recipes? Nope. Simply because we liked her, and therefore viewed her as credible. When we view someone as credible, we rely on their guidance and believe what they say. Unfortunately, this blind trust can create emotional blinders that cause us to miss, misinterpret, or discount red flags. Credibility is not a speaker trait, but a perception created in an audience. Credible, likeable, well-spoken communicators are believed to possess a wide range of positive traits including reliability, trustworthiness, goodwill, and expertise. Believe it or not, we also view such people as an authority, even when we do not have any personal knowledge of their credentials. Wendy L Patrick is the author of RED FLAGS: How to Spot Frenemies, Underminers, and Toxic People . The Power of Attraction—the Halo Effect . Belle Gibson is an attractive young woman with an endearing personality. We can´t help but smile as we watch the video footage documenting her journey, including her hopes, dreams, and bright plans for the future. Belle´s emotional appeal stems from the halo effect—where we tend to clothe attractive, likeable people with a host of other positive characteristics that they do not have. These characteristics include trustworthiness and honesty. 'Once we form a positive impression of another person, good luck trying to change our mind' Trading Rose Colored Glasses for Reading Glasses . Once we form a positive impression of another person, good luck trying to change our mind. We are incredibly resistant to negative information that threatens an emotionally pleasing positive impression we have of someone we have grown to like, respect, or admire. So many people fell in love with Belle´s approachable, endearing, likeable persona, they were fanatical in their support of her straightforward, simple, healthy strategy of battling one of the world´s deadliest conditions. The lesson here? The next time you hear a seemingly unbelievable story narrated by an attractive, emotional pleasing storyteller, trade in your rose colored classes for reading glasses, to ensure that you can and should believe what you see. Dr. Patrick's book outlines how to spot 'emotional blinders' and what red flags to pay attention to .

"FIFA presidential candidate Luis Figo on Wednesday disputed the Confederation of African Football's claim that all 54 votes from the continent will go to incumbent Sepp Blatter in the presidential elections next month. The former Portugal international, in Egypt at the CAF Congress to canvass for votes, told Sportsmail he did not believe all Africa was solidly behind Blatter, who seeks re-election on May 29 against Figo, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan and the Dutch football association president Michael van Praag. 'I feel there's a lot of respect for CAF among all the African federations but I'm positive that (CAF president) Mr (Issa) Hayatou did not speak in the name of the 54 members of the confederation,' said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder. Luis Figo does not believe that Sepp Blatter will receive ALL 54 votes from African nations . Blatter (left) has received the backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) 'Even when he (Hayatou) announced he would support Blatter, we could notice a difference from past congresses when a statement like that normally is followed by a standing ovation. 'This time we heard just a normal applause, which confirms my idea that a lot of African countries understand and agree with the need to change for the better of everyone, especially the national associations. 'In fact there were federation presidents who ensured me they would vote for me but they were reluctant to saying this out loud because they feared reactions against them, their federations and even their countries,' said Figo. 'It also to end this kind of atmosphere that I decided to be a candidate. Football should be about a beautiful game and people should be able to express themselves freely and openly.' Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency . Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe . The CAF congress in Cairo ended on Tuesday with Hayatou declaring Africa's complete support for Blatter's re-election but on all previous occasions when the CAF chief has promised a block of African votes, many have broken ranks. When Blatter came to power in 1998, Hayatou pledged Africa's votes to rival Lennart Johansson of Sweden but most defied him to vote Blatter into power. When Hayatou stood against Blatter in 2002, almost half the African countries voted for the Swiss rather than their own confederation president."
"Christine Carriage, 67, (pictured) was handed a six-month suspended sentence at Norwich Crown Court . A grandmother hoarded 1,300 items of stolen clothing in her tiny bungalow – which police said was like a ‘warehouse’. Officers raiding Christine Carriage’s one-bedroom home found that 340 of the stolen items still had price tags on. But this week the 67-year-old walked free from court. A total of 1,337 items of clothing, shoes and handbags – valued at £5,620 – were seized by police from the home in Bowthorpe, Norwich, on November 4, 2013. William Carter, prosecuting, said police found an 8ft-long clothes rail bending under the huge weight of the clothing in one room. He said: ‘The officers described the property as looking more like a clothing warehouse than a dwelling. Each room was packed.’ On Wednesday, Carriage admitted acquiring, using or possessing criminal property. When police searched the house, she was at the property with son Shane Carriage, 45, and grandson Luke Hall. Officers found cash, drug paraphernalia and at least an eighth of a kilo of cocaine. Carriage had convictions for dishonesty from the 1960s and 1970s, and two convictions for shoplifting in the 1980s, as well as one in 1996 and another in 2012. Philippa Page, defending, said some items were Carriage’s clothes and those of her son, grandson and late husband. She said Carriage was guilty of mistaken family loyalty in allowing her ‘increasingly out-of-control’ grandson to store stolen clothes at her home. Sentencing Carriage, Judge Maureen Bacon told her: ‘You have been a dishonest woman through all your life. 'I don’t see why I should inflict your keep on the public purse by sending you to prison today.’ She was given a suspended six-month jail sentence, ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work and told to pay an £80 victim surcharge at Norwich Crown Court. But Carriage and her son were cleared of supplying cocaine last August after Recorder Peter Wallis ruled there was no case to answer. Hall had previously admitted supplying cocaine, possessing cocaine and possessing criminal property and was jailed for 34 months.

"Sorry: Journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely (pictured) is expected to apologize for an article she wrote for Rolling Stone magazine about campus rape . The journalist who wrote Rolling Stone's flawed account of a campus rape is set to apologize Sunday night, when the Columbia Journalism School publishes a review of what went wrong with her reporting. Sabrina Rubin Erdely has been silent since December, when the magazine was forced to issue an apology in the wake of several factual errors highlighted in the piece about a University of Virginia student named Jackie. In the story, titled 'A Rape on Campus', Jackie claims to have been gang raped by seven men at campus fraternity Phi Kappa Psi two years ago. But a recent investigation by the Charlottesville Police found no evidence to support her story- including the fact that the man who brought her to the fraternity the night of the alleged incident doesn't seem to exist. The Columbia Graduate School of Journalism will release their review of the botched Rolling Stone investigation at 8pm on Sunday. Following that, sources tell CNN that Erdely will release an apologetic statement and Rolling Stone will take the story down from their website. While the article initially sparked protests on campus, Erdely's reporting quickly began to fall apart as the Washington Post and  local outlets started following up on the allegations. One mistake of Erdely's previously highlighted, was the fact she agreed not to contact Jackie's alleged attackers. Scroll down for video . Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named  Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Three of Jackie's friends also denied Erdely's assertion that they discouraged the alleged victim from reporting the assault. By December 5, Rolling Stone acknowledged that there appeared 'to be discrepancies in Jackie's account.' The magazine asked for the independent review, which was conducted by the dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. The fraternity has called the article defamatory and said it was exploring its legal options. 'These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault,' said Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, after the Charlottesville police suspended their investigation. Despite its flaws, the article heightened scrutiny of campus sexual assaults amid a campaign by President Barack Obama. The University of Virginia had already been on the Department of Education's list of 55 colleges under investigation for their handling of sex assault violations. The article also prompted UVA President Teresa Sullivan to temporarily suspend Greek social events. Fraternities later agreed to ban kegs, hire security workers and keep at least three fraternity members sober at each event."
"Raheem Sterling's controversial 'It's-Not-About-The-Money' campaign led him to the Emirates Stadium, where Liverpool and Arsenal fans united to protest against the rising price of football for travelling fans.

Ms Woodford, from the Pontypridd area, is believed to have been attacked in woodland in Pontypridd on Tuesday before being taken back to the property of a man she is thought to have left a town centre pub with, police said. The 47-year-old's body was discovered with 'massive injuries' at the flat around 3pm on Friday afternoon, prompting police to launch a murder investigation. Her family today paid tribute to Ms Woodford, who was last seen by them around 12.45pm on April 21 in Rhydyfelin. They said: 'Tracey was liked and loved by all of her family and friends. She was very kind-hearted and a selfless person who would go out of her way to help anyone. 'Tracey was a gentle person who would not hurt anyone and she will be dearly missed by all who knew her. 'We are thankful for all the support we have received to date.' They added that they would like everyone to respect their wishes for privacy and leave them alone to grieve. Ms Woodford was reported missing on Wednesday and her body was discovered after police received information she was with a man at the Skinny Dog pub for around two hours that night. She is believed to have left the premises with him. A police spokesman said: 'Police officers then visited the suspect's address and, following a search of the property, discovered a body. The suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder.'

"Baseball has long been considered America's favorite pastime, so it should come as no surprise that most people feel very strongly when it comes to their favorite professional team. And there are no two baseball teams that are greater, or more storied, than eternal rivals the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, who come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite. Also making a very impressive showing are the Texas Rangers and Atlanta Braves, who have fans across a wide area in the South. Then there are a few teams who don't get as much love - like the New York Mets. Scroll down for video . A new Facebook graph reveals the favorite baseball teams in the country by sorting through people's likes and breaking down winners by county . The New York Yankees (left) and Boston Red Sox (right) come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite . The Mets are not the favorite team in one county in the country, with fans in their area seeming to all go for the Yankees. Same goes for the Oakland Athletics. The Toronto Blue Jays can also claim almost all of Canada, though the Yankees and Red Sox are also favorites in some areas. The graph, created by Facebook, uses profile likes and then breaks the individuals down by country to determine a winner. And with the exception of those aforementioned Yankees, Red Sox and recent World Series champs San Francisco Giants, who get some love in Hawaii, most teams only really get support near their home field."
"The heartbroken mother of Becky Watts has spoken of her fear of coming face-to-face with Anje Galsworthy - whose son is accused of the teenager's murder. Tania Watts is likely to see her at Becky's funeral, as Ms Galsworthy was also stepmother to the 16-year-old. Speaking to ITV today, Ms Watts spoke of the 'hell' she has endured since the murder, adding: 'I'm still in the back of my mind not accepting...that I'm not going to see her.' Murdered: The body parts of Becky Watts, 16, were found at house in Bristol on March 2 and police charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder . Dreading meeting: Becky's heartbroken mother Tani Watts said she fears coming face-to-face with Anjie Galsworthy, (pictured with Becky's father Darren) whose son is accused of the teenager's murder . Becky, 16, vanished from her father's family home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on February 19, sparking a huge search operation. Police discovered her body parts at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, on March 2 and charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder. In an ITV interview, Ms Watts described her daughter as a 'caring, normal, happy, lovely girl'. She said: 'She made you feel alive. Everyone loved her. Knowing it's happened, it's like you are talking about someone else's kid. 'You shouldn't have to bury a child. There are a lot of people on this Earth who don't deserve to be here but Becky was not one of them. 'She should be here.' Accused: Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews is set to go on trial for the 16-year-old's murder . Mr Matthews is pictured in fancy dress alongside his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, who is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police . Becky grew up with her parents - mother Ms Watts and father Darren Galsworthy - living in separate homes but often tried to bring them together. Ms Watts added: 'That was her aim to make sure we all got on and this is why it was so upsetting because she succeeded in that. 'The one person who was so loyal, so caring and loved us all equally has now gone.' Ms Watts said her daughter was a regular guest at her home, visiting twice a week or so depending on her busy social life. 'She had some hard times in the past, she was very insecure, unconfident, but she got her confidence back and she got a bit of fight in her,' she said. Ms Watts cannot comprehend how, Nathan Matthews, the man accused of her daughter's murder comes from within the 16 year old's home - and she is understandably nervous about seeing his mother, Ms Galsworthy. Becky's family home - where she lived with Mr and Mrs Galsworthy - has been the subject of forensic searches since she was reported missing on February 20. Police launched a huge search operation, which included a social media campaign, using the hashtag 'FindBecky'. Anjie and Darren Galsworthy are pictured speaking in a video appeal one week after the 16-year-old's disappearance . A house in Barton Court, Bristol, is cordoned off on March 3 after police discovered the body parts of murdered Becky . Bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at the family home, as well as at Barton Court where her body parts were found. Two online fundraising pages have also raised more than £11,000, which will pay for Becky's funeral and a foundation in her memory. Mr Matthews, of Warmley, South Gloucestershire, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on March 26, along with five others charged in connection with the death. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police. Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of helping dispose of and conceal Becky's body parts. A plea hearing has been set for August 4, with a provisional trial date of October 5. All six defendants have been remanded in custody.

"An 18-year-old mother-of-one had two heart attacks before dying from multiple organ failure after taking M-Cat at a house party, her family have said. Abby Swinfield, from Castle Donington, in Derbyshire, was partying with friends when she was rushed to hospital in the early hours of March 30. Miss Swinfield, who is believed to have a son, three, was taken to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, where she was placed in a coma, but died a week later. Abby Swinfield, 18, a mother-of-one from Castle Donington, in Derbyshire, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of March 30 after a house party in Tamworth where it is thought she took M-Cat . Following Miss Swinfield's death, police have arrested one girl for supplying drugs, but Miss Swinfield's cousin has claimed she didn't take the drug voluntarily, saying her drink was spiked . Neighbours say ambulances arrived at this property at 1am. After arriving at hospital Miss Swinfield was put into a coma, but died a week later . Police are still waiting for the result of the post-mortem but it is believed the teenager had taken the illegal Class B drug Mephedrone - more commonly known as MCat or Meow Meow. Miss Swinfield's mother Kay, 39, said: 'I'm devastated. It happened at [her friend] Lauren's house. 'Abby hadn't seen Lauren in three years but she kept contacting her and saying ""come to mine for a party. We got a phone call that night saying she was at the hospital. 'Doctors told me she died of multiple organ failure after suffering two heart attacks. 'They said she'd been lying in the same position for a long time because she had a big blister on her back.' Abby's cousin Lydia Moore, 18, added: 'We don't think she took it on her own accord. We think her drink was spiked. 'Abby was a perfect girl who would be there for you if you needed it. She had an amazing heart. She had so many friends. Miss Swinfield's mother, Kay, said she is 'devastated' over her daughter's death, saying she suffered two heart attacks before dying of multiple organ failure after taking the drug . Miss Swinfield has a son, who is believed to be three years old. Her cousin Lydia Moore, 18, said the youngster keeps asking for his mother . 'She had a beautiful son and she loved him. What's heartbreaking is her son keeps asking for his mom. Someone has taken his mom from him. The family has been torn apart.' Police have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying Class B drugs, and she has been released on bail. Staffordshire police said they have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying drugs, amid allegations Miss Swinfield's drink was spiked . Linus Pebliauskas, 29, who lives on Bridgwater Street, where the party was held, said: 'I didn't know who lived at the house but there were many young lads going in and out of there. 'There was drinking throughout the day and not just at weekends. It was a bit of a party house from what I could tell.' Yesterday a friend who was at the party, but did not want to be named, added: 'We are in absolute shock. 'There was a house party and there were loads of people there, I don't know how she got the drugs. 'She had a three-year-old boy, it is so tragic. 'Her mum Kay is absolutely distraught. She is really angry about what happened and the fact there were drugs at this party. 'She had come down to visit friends and have a good night out and now she is dead, I cannot believe it. 'She was a very popular girl and we are just completely numb at the moment. I can't get my head around it.' A spokeswoman for Staffordshire Police added: 'She has been released on police bail pending further investigation until a date in June. 'A post-mortem examination will take place in the coming days to help establish the cause of death. 'Anyone with information on the incident is urged to call Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident 790 of March 30.' Police had previously warned about the use of M-Cat in Tamworth after a raid two months ago during which 4lbs of the drug, worth thousands of pounds, was discovered."
"A pre-med student in New York City is taking microscopic images of diseases and other biological structures and turning them into prints for her innovative new athletic apparel and accessories line. Lizzie Cochran, a student at Columbia University, has launched a KickStarter campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line Epidemia Designs, which she came up with after spending days upon days staring at cells through microscopes in her biology classes, and then spotting an article on epidemics that displayed images of deadly diseases from recent history. 'The one that jumped out at me was the flu of 1918 virus,' Lizzie told Today. 'It was one of the most devastating epidemics in the history of the world, but there on the page, colored with dyes, it just looked incredible, interesting and vibrant.' Scroll down for video . From the microscope to the mat: Proposed clothing line Epidemia will take images from biology and print them on eye-catching active apparel . Picture of health: Among the designs is a sports bra showing images from a healthy mammogram . Lizzie, who will be returning to her native Texas for medical school in the fall at University of Texas San Antonio, was soon mocking up ideas for clothing incorporating the beautiful and unique imagery she'd seen on slides during her classes. Using mirroring, Photoshop and kaleidoscope effects, each biological subject was turned into an eye-catching pattern that could be printed on fabric. The designs in the line include scarves printed with rabies and chicken pox patterns, a flu of 1918 tote bag and yoga pants depicting polio, muscle cells and rabies. The patterns will also be available for printing on iPhone cases after the company, which has already raised $13,798, reaches its $15,000 crowdfunding goal. In her design work, Lizzie also began to see the potential for changing perceptions of infectious diseases, as well as the relatively apathy towards them that results in the preventable deaths of 1.5 million children per year simply because they haven't been vaccinated. The brains of the outfit: Pre-med student Lizzie Cochran came up with the idea for the fashion line after studying biology under a microscope . Giving 'cell phone' a whole new meaning: Epidemia will offer phone cases with eye catching patterns from microscopic images including that of heart tissue, chicken pox and polio . From the Petri dish to the yoga pant: Epidemia legging,s like the pair featuring a lung x-ray design pictured, will initially be priced at around $75 . 'Frankly, it's unacceptable,' Lizzie told Today. 'It's not like we're trying to solve an unsolvable problem. We really have the power to lead the way toward a healthier future. We already have the tools.' With this idea in mind, Lizzie is promising to send 15 per cent of the profits to funding projects aimed at limiting the impact of preventable diseases such as polio, rubella and hepatitis, as well as expanding medical care access around the globe. Now, with an expanding team - and an exploding online following - Epidemia's goal of $15,000 has nearly been reached, meaning the line is just on the cusp of going into production. Team Epidemia: Based on the strength of her idea, Lizzie has enlisted a new VP of retail, Taylor Newby (third from right), and several friends as models for the project . Showing off their muscles: The Kickstarter campaign to produce the clothing for the public has nearly reached its goal of $15,000 . The first group of designs lined up will be called 'She's Got It' will have the theme of beauty in a woman's body and will feature images of brain, nerve, heart and epithelial (stomach). Aside from bringing awareness of preventable diseases to the forefront, the 'She's Got It' line has its own unique purpose. 'We hope women will wear these clothes and feel empowered to join the discussions of public health, science and technology that are so vital to our world,' Lizzie explained. 'Our hope is that our stylish, feminine, fun, and most importantly, interesting designs will appeal to girls of all ages - and maybe encourage them to get involved in the scientific community.'"

"Chris Ramsey has pledged his long-term future to QPR – insisting he will remain at the club for as long as they want him. Ramsey was handed the manager’s job until the end of the season after stepping up from his youth development coaching role when Harry Redknapp resigned in February. Rangers’ Premier League status is hanging by the thread following Sunday’s last-gasp defeat by Chelsea at Loftus Road, but Ramsey insists he is more than happy to remain in W12 regardless of what division they are in next season, although he hopes to be made permanent boss. Chris Ramsey insists he's happy at Queens Park Rangers and will stay at the club for as long as they want him . In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail the 52-year-old said: ‘I’m a QPR person now, whatever happens there’s a long-term project at the club which Les (Ferdinand) has put into place anyway. ‘We’re going to try and build the academy in order to emulate one or two of the clubs who we can see have excelled in the Premier League with the right foundations in place. ‘As long as the club want me I will remain here – it’s as simple as that. I want to stay at QPR, I’m really happy. The 52-year-old is a popular and respected man within the game, with aspirations of getting the full-time job . ‘To be honest with you QPR have been quite loyal to me as when I first joined I got offered a few first-team jobs elsewhere and I didn’t take them, but they allowed me to talk to these clubs and they could have easily told me to do one then but they didn’t, so I feel like I owe them. ‘So now I’m going to stand by them and show them some loyalty.’ Speculation has been rife that Ramsey will link up with his former Tottenham colleague Tim Sherwood at Aston Villa this summer if he wasn’t handed the job on a permanent basis, but he says his mind is focused solely on QPR currently. Reports suggest that Ramsey could link up with friend Tim Sherwood (left) at Aston Villa in the summer . ‘At the moment all I am thinking about is staying at QPR,’ admitted Ramsey. ‘Regardless of whether we stay up or not I think I’ve got a fighting chance of getting the job (on a permanent basis). ‘Obviously I think Les wants me to be the manager because he knows I can do the job, and I think Tony (Fernandes) would want me to be in charge, too.' QPR owner Tony Fernandes is the man who will make the final decision as to who becomes the next manager . Speaking at the ‘Sport On Board’ graduation event at Wembley on Wednesday night, a group designed to help improve diversity across the boardrooms in football, the former Tottenham coach spoke glowingly about Ferdinand – who was appointed as the club’s director of football in the wake of Redknapp’s departure. The pair both graduated from the course last year, with Ramsey highlighting how pivotal a role it has played in Ferdinand’s career especially. He added: ‘For Les especially this course has been fantastic. He’s always said this is the job he’s wanted and already I can see what a great job he is doing. Director of football Les Ferdinand (left) would like his friend Ramsey to get the job on a permanent basis . ‘There is no doubt in my mind he will go on to become one of the best in that field, and he will turn this club round one way or another.’ Ramsey himself has aspirations of becoming a top manager one day, with the No 1 hotseat the thing he has his heart set on right now. ‘I’m at that stage in my life now where if a managerial position came up I’d have to take it – and hopefully that will be at QPR. ‘These jobs are limited in the game and you may never have an opportunity to be a No 1 again. Star man Charlie Austin could be off in the summer - regardless of whether QPR stay in the Premier League . ‘You know what in the end I might not be a good enough No 1, but I think I will be. ‘So then you go and give your utmost and without banging the drum too much be confident in your own ability, which I am. ‘The main thing for anybody, unless you're very famous, is to stay in the industry, though. I’m blessed to have remained involved in the game for as long as I have been.'"
"An anonymous Good Samaritan has donated $360,000 to pay for a man's mortgage after he lost his wife and house in the mudslide that swept Washington last year. Tim Ward and his wife of 38 years, Brandy, were at home in Oso, Washington, on March 22, 2014, when tons of debris, soil and rock came crashing down from upland. Brandy was one of the 43 people crushed by the force of the natural disaster. Tim, who broke his pelvis, was buried under 25 feet of mud, but managed to call for help through a gap in the surface. Just a week later, as Tim started trying to rebuild his life, he was informed he did not have 'landslide insurance' - and therefore did not qualify for payment to settle his mortgage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Brandy Ward (right) was killed in the mudslide that swept Oso, Washington, in March last year. Her husband Tim (left) survived and has spent the past year trying to pay his mortgage, which a donor has now paid . Horrific: The mudslide on March 22, 2014, killed 43 people including Brandy Ward . For a year, Tim has been grappling with his financial predicament, while renting a small property nearby. He lost everything in the mudflow. Only one of their five dogs survived the mudslide, but lost a leg. The disaster killed their turkeys, chickens and four canines. The mortgage, however, consumed him. But last week, he received a call from Chase Bank, who said an anonymous donor had paid the lot. Before: This was their idyllic home in Oso where they reared turkeys and chickens before the mudslide . Love: The couple were married for 38 years. Tim said he heard Brandy call for him before she was killed . Overwhelmed: Ward said he couldn't believe it when Chase Bank told him the mortgage was all paid for . Speaking to NBC News, Tim said: 'There are still good Samaritans out there. This is life-changing.' He recalled the horrific day last year: 'She called my name and yelled, ""Tim!"" And from the moment that voice left her body, she had left the man she had been with for 38 years to be with the son of God she'll be with forever.' The donor told bank clerks they had read about Ward in a newspaper and felt compelled to reach out. 'I honestly have never seen this kind of an act of personal generosity where it's anonymous,' Phyllis Campbell, vice president at JP Morgan Chase, told NBC News."

"A baby girl was given hypothermia in order to keep her alive after she developed a potentially fatal brain condition. Caitlin Kellie-Jones suffered from Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood. To control the condition Caitlin was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth to keep her at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees for 72 hours. Nicola Kellie-Jones and partner Paul with children Caitlin and Dylan are raising money to help other children . Medics gave little Caitlin, pictured, hypothermia in a bid to prevent any brain damage . Caitlin, pictured, was diagnosed with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy minutes after she was born . It allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen. Thankfully, Caitlin, now ten months old, recovered from HIE and is able to feed and play. Her parents, Nicola and Paul, are hoping it will not have affected her ability to walk and talk but they must wait to find out. Ms Kellie-Jones,  27, from Chorley, Lancashire, said: 'Caitlin was in an incubator surrounded by doctors and nurses. 'She wasn't moving or breathing for herself, and was making no noise. 'I had an image in my mind of our first cuddle which was taken away. Doctors were telling us she was very poorly and just to take it hour by hour. 'It was such a relief to bring her home.' Caitlin was born on May 10 last year weighing 7lbs 4oz after a normal pregnancy. She was whisked away by doctors immediately to be placed on a specialist cooling machine. Despite her ordeal, Caitlin, who is now 10 months old, seems to be developing normally . Ms Kellie-Jones, right, wants to raise £16,000 for additional cooling machines to help save other babies . Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'My mum was a neonatal nurse for many years and I often visited her at work and would see all of these babies in their little incubators and see families in and out visiting their babies, but I never imagined it would be me. Ms Kellie-Jones said the next important stage is whether she will be able to walk and talk normally . 'We couldn't look to the days ahead and my mum told me to take lots of pictures. I knew what they were all trying to tell me, everyone thought she wouldn't make it. 'I didn't move from her side for hours. I had the doctors and nurses tell me the worst case scenario so I could prepare myself, but it was very upsetting to hear she might not make it. 'Paul was the opposite, he wanted to know the best possible outcome. 'We were lucky that we were able to get Caitlin on one of the machines, otherwise we might not have been bringing her home.' Caitlin was born and treated at Royal Preston Hospital, where there are only two cooling machines available. Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'We are extremely lucky that the last cooling machine was available for our daughter that day. 'I'm trying to raise money now for two cerebral function machines for the hospital, which monitor brain activity for any signs of brain damage, and, if I raise enough, another cooling machine for the neonatal unit. 'My target is to raise at least £16,000. 'Her brother Dylan, 10, is doing a sponsored bike ride with his granddad to help too. 'At his age he could have thought what happened to Caitlin was normal, but he came to see her every night and loves her to pieces.' Caitlin will need follow up appointments until she is two, but it is hoped she will make a full recovery. To donate go to: www.justgiving.com/CaitlinsCoolingCause . Ms Kellie-Jones said without the cooling machine, Caitlin might not have survived her illness ."
"FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has admitted that he is still considering whether to join Premier League leaders Chelsea this summer. Earlier this month club president Naoki Ogane claimed that the Blues have made an offer - believed to be around £4million - for the  Japan international. Chelsea would look to loan Muto to partner club Vitesse Arnhem next season but the 22-year-old is keen to join a club where he will play regularly and realise his potential. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has a shot against Shonan Bellmare during a J-League clash . Chelsea have made an offer for Muto according to FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane . Asked about a potential switch to London this summer after scoring the winner against Shonan Bellmare last week, Muto said: 'I want to think about it carefully. 'Where can I go to develop? A team that suits me, where I can play and develop. I'm thinking about that, and for now I just want to take my time and think it through.' Real Zaragoza boss Ranko Popovic gave Muto his debut for FC Tokyo in July 2013 and he believes the pacey forward could be a big hit at Stamford Bridge. Speaking to Bleacher Report, Popovic said: 'His potential was amazing, I didn't see for a long time such an intelligent player like Muto. He's a different guy, he's not such a usual player. 'Muto is something like a noble. He has something different to all other players because he comes from a good family, he has good education, he was at university. A very smart, intelligent guy. He has something which you cannot learn. 'He was so fast. So speedy and, for a Japanese guy, so strong. And also so confident. He has a lot of confidence. In our training games Muto always had chances. Amazing. He had 10 or 12 chances in every game.' Muto says he is still considering a move to Chelsea as he wants to join a club where he will 'play and develop' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had admitted that he is aware of the Japan international . Chelsea signed a £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama Rubber in February and Jose Mourinho has admitted that commercial interests do play a part in the club's transfer policy. Asked about Muto earlier this month, Mourinho said: 'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. 'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play. 'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.'"
"Yaya Toure's agent has called Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini a 'weak manager' and criticised the club's chief executive Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain. Toure's performances have come under the microscope amid a dismal run for City which has seen them go from title contenders to being in a battle simply to finish in the top four. But agent Dimitri Seluk has claimed the club are trying to make Toure a scapegoat for bigger problems behind the scenes. The agent of Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (left) has called Manuel Pellegrini, his manager, 'weak' Pellegrini has struggled this with the  champions this season, and Dimitri Seluk has placed blame on him . 'Some people at City are trying to blame Yaya for what has happened this season,' he said. 'But those people aren't taking responsibility for their own mistakes. 'I am talking about executives who have bought players for a lot of money - and then put those players on the bench. Executives who spend a lot of money on Stevan Jovetic and then drop him from the Champions League squad. I feel sorry for Pellegrini. He's a good coach, but a weak manager. 'He won the title with the team left behind by (predecessor) Roberto Mancini.' Toure, whose relationship with the club came under strain last summer, has been linked with a move away this summer, with Mancini making clear his interest in signing the 31-year-old for Inter Milan. Seluk said that it was wrong to criticise Toure over City's struggles and blamed the manager and executives . Pellegrini was described as a good coach but a weak manager by Toure's agent in a scathing attack . 'If City want Yaya to leave, they should come out and say so,' Seluk told the Sunday Mirror. 'Two of the biggest clubs have already asked me if he is available, and I know that if City would sell, another 10 would call me inside 24 hours.' City go into Sunday afternoon's match against West Ham four points above fifth-placed Liverpool and with the pressure firmly on Pellegrini. Txiki Begiristain (left) Manchester City's director of football, Ferran Soriano (centre) the CEO were criticised . Seluk picked out the decision to buy Stevan Jovetic and then leave him out of the Champions League squad . The Chilean has maintained he is not worried about his job, but admitted that could change if they dropped out of the Champions League places. 'You are wrong if you think that, at this club, if you don't win the title then you are out,' he said in a number of national newspapers. 'If we miss the top four then maybe it will be different because that would not be the same thing, the analysis of the season will be different.'"
"The say that imitation is the highest form of flattery, although Floyd Mayweather Jnr's sparring partner Jeremy 'J Flash' Nichols' impersonation of Manny Pacquiao is less than complimentary. The Filipino meets undefeated Mayweather in a $300million mega-fight that has been branded 'the biggest bout in boxing history' at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2. Mayweather has been sharing regular updates from his training camp across social media with the latest being a YouTube video featuring his sparring partner taking on Pacquiao's role during a mock interview. Floyd Maywether's sparring partner Jeremy Nichols gives a mock interview as Manny Pacquiao . 'J Flash' makes fun of the Filipino's faith, singing and claims his mother uses Voodoo . Mayweather uses a -200C kriotherapy chamber to help his recovery from training . Nichols mimics Pacquiao's Visayan accent while poking fun at the 36-year-old's decision to both write and perform his own entrance song as well as ridiculing the 'Pacman's' religious faith. The young boxer also takes a pop at Pacquiao's mother by claiming her 'voodoo powers' are the secret behind his success - so-called 'Mommy D' was accused of using Voodoo chants from ringside during her son's victory over Tomothy Bradley in April 2014. As a parting shot, Nichols refuses to refer to the fight's date in normal English and repeatedly says it will be staged on 'May two, May two!'. The up and coming boxer has not had a professional fight yet but insists he is ready for the challenge of getting Mayweather in prime shape before the contest. Mayweather takes part in a training session under the gaze of a packed media audience . Pacquiao and his coach Freddie Roach take part in a similar training session In Los Angeles . The unbeaten US fighter gets a light massage ahead of his workout in Las Vegas . Pacquiao is so popular in the Philippines that he is featured on the latest postage stamps . 'It's a blessing an opportunity to work with one of the biggest names in boxing,' he said. 'I want to make sure he knows there's someone ready to take over the 147lbs once he gets ready to hang up the gloves. 'It's a great experience and I've learned so much - I've switched my entire training regime around since I've been here. This opportunity is a blessing, I can't thank him enough for giving me the chance,' he added."

The affected stretch of the highway has been closed off, with diversions in place south of Fernvale. The Courier-Mail reports that earlier emergency crews found one person trapped inside their vehicle and Queensland Fire and Rescue crews used hydraulic cutting gear to free them. The Rescue 500 helicopter then landed at the scene and airlifted a number of patients to hospital. Police said the highway would be closed for a few hours with diversions in place south of Fernvale."
"Bruce Jenner has confirmed he started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. The 65-year-old told Diane Sawyer he embarked on hormone therapy and electrolysis, and had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine, shortly after winning the Olympic gold. However, he says, he stopped out of 'fear' of publicity and shame, and kept his secret to himself until he couldn't bear it any longer. Scroll down for video . Early signs?  Bruce Jenner has revealed he started having hormone therapy and plastic surgery in the mid to late 1980s to make himself look more feminine. He's shown here in September 1987 . Before the changes: Bruce, seen here on set, still had his athletic physique and heavy set masculine features when he appeared in the 1980 film Can't Stop The Music. These were noticeably gone by the end of the decade . Bruce said he was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. On Friday night, he publicly addressed about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. As the romance between Bruce and Kris blossomed in late 1990 and early 1991, the former star athlete  halted hormone therapy and underwent breast reduction surgery. The couple married months after meeting on April 21, 1991, and went on to have two children together - Kendall, now 19, and Kylie, 17, - before divorcing in December last year. Change of heart: Bruce halted his gender transition after meeting Kris Kardashian in late 1990. He stopped hormone injections and even underwent breast reduction surgery before the couple married.  He's seen here with Kris in February 1993 . Family man:  Bruce and Kris tied the knot in April 1991 just months after meeting. Seen here in 2000 with their daughters Kendall and Kylie, the couple were married for 22 years. Bruce found fame again with a whole new generation thanks to the reality series about their blended family Keeping Up With The Kardashians . A source quoted by Entertainment Tonight says that Bruce was greatly influenced by the life story of transgender tennis player Renee Richards. Richards, born a boy Richard Raskind in 1934, underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1975. In 1976, she launched a legal challenge after the US Tennis Association denied her permission to compete as a woman in the U.S. Open because she had not been born a woman and in 1977 the New York Supreme Court ruled in her favor in a landmark decision for transsexual rights. It's believed that her autobiography Second Serve, published in 1983, had a significant influence on Bruce. In 1986, the book was made into a TV movie starring Vanessa Redgrave who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Inspiration: Transgender tennis player Renee Richards won the right to complete as a woman in the 1977 U.S. Open after winning a landmark legal battle. Richards was born a boy in 1934 . Textbook transition: It's suggested that Bruce was greatly influenced by Richards' life story as outlined in her 1983 autobiography Second Serve. The Kardashian-Jenner patriarch and reality TV star addressed his gender journey during the two-hour prime time special airing tonight on ABC. He says: 'I wanna know how this story ends, you know? How does my story end?' In a message of support, TV's Dr. Phil told ET on Thursday that he's happy for the Olympian. 'This is his body and his life, and he needs to do what he wants to do,' said Dr. Phil. 'It drains your spirit if you can't be yourself. He is freeing himself.' The interview was conducted before Jenner was involved in an auto accident in which another motorist was killed. Nervous: Bruce Jenner is seen greeting Diane Sawyer at his home in the latest promo video released Thursday ahead of the airing of his sit-down interview in which he is expected to address his gender transition . Resolute: The former decathlete tells the journalist that it is 'going to be an emotional rollercoaster but somehow I'm gonna get through it' Looking to the future: The clip released Thursday concluded with Bruce asking, 'how does my story end?' Tight lid: ABC has only released snippets with non-specific quotes from Bruce, paving the way for his story to air in full tonight . Moral support: The 65-year-old father-of-six appears alongside his four oldest children  Burt, 36, Casey, 34, Brandon, 33, and Brody, 31; the latest clip reused this previously aired footage from another promo . Not appearing in the interview: Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Kourtney Kardashian, 36, as well as Kendall, 19, and Kylie Jenner, 17, are not scheduled to talk during the interview ."
"Russia is considering bailing out Greece in exchange for the country’s ‘assets’, it was reported last night. Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas in a bid to lessen its dependence on the West . The visit will raise fears the radical left government is looking east in search of alternative sources of finance as it bids to avoid bankruptcy. Scroll down for video . Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin (pictured earlier this week) in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas . Ahead of his visit, Mr Tsipras condemned the West’s economic sanctions on Moscow as ‘a road to nowhere’. But Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, has already warned it would be ‘unacceptable’ if Mr Tsipras ‘jeopardised Europe’s common policy on Russia’ in return for Kremlin aid. Kommersant newspaper quoted an anonymous Russian government source last night saying that lines of credit were being offered. ‘We’re ready to consider the question of providing Greece discounts on gas: the price for it is tied to the cost of oil which has significantly fallen in recent months,’ the source said. ‘We are also ready to discuss the possibility of granting Greece new loans. But here we, in turn, are interested in reciprocal moves – in particular, in Russia receiving particular assets in Greece.’ Yesterday Greece demanded more than £200billion in compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. The government unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations stemming from occupation by the Third Reich. The radical left Syriza party says Germany owes Greece nearly 279billion euros, or £204billion to compensate it for looting and war crimes. The German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago. Greece’s defence minister said it had obtained ‘stunning evidence’ to support its massive claims for reparations. Panos Kammenos said the country had obtained records held by the US military that review the extent of damage to private and public property during the Nazi occupation. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, Mr Tsipras (pictured) condemned the West’s economic sanctions on Moscow as ‘a road to nowhere’. Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt in a matter of days . The demand comes just days before Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt to the International Monetary Fund. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country ‘intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum’. Greece suffered a brutal occupation at the hands Adolf Hitler’s forces in 1941. More than 40,000 people are believed to have starved to death in Athens alone. Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Mr Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim. It includes the cost of a 10billion euro forced Nazi loan made by the Bank of Greece and the return of archaeological treasures. The revised figures amount to nearly 10 per cent of Germany’s GDP. Mr Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month. He has called the reparations question a ‘moral and ethical’ issue for his country. The new figure was revealed yesterday by Greek deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas. ‘According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,’ he told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece’s debt crisis. Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece’s state general accounting office. Berlin paid 115m deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation – a fraction of the Greek demand. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised the issue of compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month (pictured) Greece says this did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan. Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified. Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for the hardship suffered by Greeks under the tough bailout conditions imposed by international lenders. Ministers have floated the idea of seizing German assets in the country to compensate the families of victims of Nazi war crimes. A poll carried for Greek radio found more than 80 per cent of Greeks agreed with the pusuit of Nazi war debt claims. Yesterday Greek MPs also voted to establish a committee examining the circumstances of its 2010 bail-out by eurozone creditors and the IMF to the tune of 240billion euros. ‘After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people,’ Mr Tsipras said. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed the economy was unfairly lumbered with the liabilities that it is now struggling to pay off as its coffers run empty. He has claimed Europe dealt with his country’s bankruptcy by ‘loading the largest loan in human history on the weakest of shoulders - the Greek taxpayer’."
"Leanna Norris (pictured during her trial) admitted killing her young daughter . A mother who drugged her young daughter with allergy medicine before smothering her to death has been jailed for 37 years. Leanna Norris, 25, of Auburn,  plied two-year-old Loh Grenada with Benedryl to make her sleep before by covering her mouth and nose with duct tape and a blanket, a court heard. The body was found in the front seat of her car in Stetson, Maine, on June 24, 2013. Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norrishad committed the murder to stop her ex-boyfriend, the father of her child, dating other women. 'She did not want (his new girlfriends) mothering her child,' reported the Bangor Daily News. Norris wept as she told the Judge: 'I want it to be known that I'm sorry to everyone that I have hurt,' reported the newspaper. 'All I ever wanted was for her to be safe and us to be together forever.' The court heard that Norris had suffered from mental health problems including depression, and had tried to commit suicide after she killed her daughter. But Superior Court Justice Ann Murray had rejected Norris' insanity defense and found her guilty. Norris admitted to investigators that on the evening of June 23, 2013, she drove her daughter, Loh Melody Grenda, to Durham Bridge Road in Newport and gave her three times the normal dose of an antihistamine. She put duct tape over the girl’s mouth and nose, then smothered her with a blanket so she would not have to watch her die, according to the trial testimony. The mother then drove to a cemetery in Stetson and took the rest of the antihistamine and swallowed 200 Advil pills in a suicide attempt. Norris told police that she had broken up with Loh’s father and he had threatened to try to get sole custody of the girl. Norris, 25, had drugged two-year-old Loh Grenada (pictured) then covered her mouth and nose with duct tape . Cowardly act: The court heard that Norris allegedly had covered her daughter with a blanket while she smothered her so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes' Martha Harris, who is representing Norris, told the courtroom that her client was depressed and had both anxiety and mood disorders last year, according to the newspaper. Norris' ex-boyfriend Michael Grenda, who was the father to two-year-old Loh Grenda, testified about the parents' estranged relationship, according to the newspaper. His testimony reportedly included that the couple's verbal disputes led to police being dispatched on multiple occasions -- and though Grenda broke up with Norris on June 16, 2013, the two agreed to stay and parent in the same residence. Norris' digital communications with different men stopped a potential reunion, he also said, according to Bangor Daily News. Grenda reportedly recounted his telling Norris on June 23 'that was the end of everything' - and then 'She became very upset. She was crying and smashing her head against the wall.' The 27-year-old's testimony also reportedly revealed that Norris cooled off that morning through his help, he left the home in the afternoon, and found out what happened to Loh Grenda on June 24. Suicidal: Leanna Norris allegedly asked for a gun after her daughter's death in order to take her own life . Testimony: Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norris knowingly committed the murder and 'did not want Mike dating other women and did not want them mothering her child . The suspect's father Steven Norris said he received a 2.27am phone call on June 24 from his daughter, in which she admitted to killing Loh. He then contacted the authorities while Norris was one the phone with her mother. Norris later turned up at her parents' home with the dead body inside the car. He told the court she had been feeling suicidal and had asked for a gun, according to the Bangor Daily News. Her affidavit by Maine State Police Detective Thomas Pickering said she offered 'two or three syringes of Benadryl to make [Loh Grenda] go to sleep.' 'Leanna Norris put black Gorilla [duct] tape on Loh Grenda's mouth and nose; that Leanna Norris put a blanket over Loh Grenda's face so she would not have to look at Loh's eyes,' the affidavit reportedly said. ' Leanna Norris said that she killed Loh Grenda; that Leanna Norris put her hand over Loh Grenda's face and suffocated her.' Judge: Superior Court Justice Ann Murray is pictured at the bench during the trial at Penobscot Judicial Center, Bangor . Assistant Attorney General Leann Zainea appears for the prosecution (left) across from defense attorney Martha Harris (right) Norris said she took the tape off 'so it would not look so horrible', the affidavit is said to reveal. Later at a Stetson cemetery was 'where [Leanna Norris] took pills and put tape on her face in order to kill herself,' the affidavit also reportedly said. But, after vomiting, the 24-year-old allegedly called her father, Steven Norris, and then drove to his house, where he discovered his granddaughter dead under a blanket. Norris, who had asked to be tried without a jury, had told the judge that she didn't set out to kill her daughter and her defense asked for the minimum sentence of 25 years. But Mr Grenada, Loh's father, had branded the request 'a joke' and recommended a 45 term for the 'premeditated' killing. Justice Murray sentenced Norris to 37 years in prison after taking into account the child's suffering and her mother's mental illness."
"Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed ""powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children."" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. ""It was horror,"" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. ""People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone."" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: ""If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater,"" he said. ""Blackwater killed my son."" Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government ""should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened."" Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first .

Rob MacFarlane captured photos of the raccoon on his crane after it climbed about 213 meters up. MacFarlane shared his first picture of 'Little Mac' on social media on Thursday morning after the crapping critter presumably made the climb over the course of the night. Rob MacFarlane shared the picture of the brave raccoon, 'Little Mac', on social media on Thursday morning . The little critter climbed almost 700 feet up MacFarlane's tower crane in Toronto before being photographed . He wrote: 'This critter climbed over 700' to crap on my machine deck.'

The crane he was working on stands east of the Rogers Centre at Yonge and the Esplanade in downtown Toronto. In addition to pooping on cranes, raccoons also have been getting into the city's garbage bins. The Toronto City Council is considering a $31million investment in new compost bins featuring turn-dial locks that raccoons cannot open. Mayor John Tory said: 'We have left no stone unturned in our fight against the Raccoon Nation. 'Defeat is not an option.'"
"Usain Bolt says Tyson Gay should have been given a longer ban for drugs cheating, and branded the decision to shorten his punishment 'the stupidest thing I've ever heard'. Gay had his suspension reduced after he agreed to co-operate with authorities, and is now set to compete against Bolt after returning to the sport. But Bolt said he felt 'let down' by the American sprinter, and is not looking forward to competing against a man he used to respect. Usain Bolt says Tyson Gay's reduced ban is 'the stupidest thing I've ever heard' after his doping suspension . Bolt said he used to respect Gay as a competitor, but is no longer looking forward to racing against him . 1. Usain Bolt - Berlin 2009 - 9.58 . 2. Usain Bolt - London 2012 - 9.63 . 3=. Usain Bolt - Beijing 2008 - 9.69 . 3=. Tyson Gay - Berlin 2009 - 9.69 . 3=. Yohan Blake - Lausanne 2012 - 9.69 . 'I was really upset about that,' the world's fastest man said in an interview with Runners World, extracts of which have been published by The Times. 'He got a year just because he talked to the authorities about how it was done and who helped him. 'That sends the wrong message: 'If you do it and get caught, just tell us all you know and we'll lower your ban. 'It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. The message should be: ""If you cheat you're going to be kicked out of the sport.""' Bolt stressed that he had regarded Gay, the joint-second fastest man of all time behind the Jamaican, as a rival who kept him on his toes, but now says he will feel no joy competing against the disgraced sprinter. Bolt is the fastest man of all time, but Gay is close behind him and is now returning to the sport . 'It really bothers me,' he added. 'I'm not worried about him beating me, I think it's because I respected him so much over the years. He was a competitor, kept me on my toes and he pushed me to always do my best. 'Then to find out that he was on drugs — it's a bit like I think parents must feel when they have a kid who does something bad and lets them down. I feel like he let me down and he let the sport down.'"
"If there's someone who isn't scared to show her colourful side in these times of taupe and elephant breathe, it is celebrated interior designer Abigail Ahern. Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I’ve ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette – silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys – it’s what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour', come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don’t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot’s Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room – say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you’ll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You’ll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I’m sure I’d be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo – all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery – you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don’t neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you’ve made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

"Reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson admits he must 'improve as a man' after his fellow professionals appeared to choose him as the most unpopular player on the PGA Tour. An ESPN.com survey of 103 tour professionals - 21 of whom were major champions - anonymously answered questions on a wide range of topics, including which player they would not help in a fight in the car park. Watson, who is chasing a third green jacket at Augusta this week, got double the number of responses (22.6 per cent) of second-place finisher Patrick Reed (11 per cent), with Rory Sabbatini third and Robert Allenby fourth. Bubba Watson speaks during his press conference at Augusta National on Tuesday . The reigning champion skips a ball across the water on the 16th hole during a practice round . Watson has won two green jackets but not a popularity contest among his peers . Asked on Tuesday whether the survey results irritated him, Watson replied: 'No, I take it as I need to improve as a man. I take it with pride. I need to get better. 'And I think over my career, since my rookie season to now, I've gotten better. 'But obviously there's more room for me to improve as a man, and hopefully the next year or the year after I will. 'It's a challenge. It's great. I'm glad that it came out and it's going to help me improve. 'So if it's a bad thing and people don't like me, then I've got to improve and prove them wrong.' Watson walks down the 12th fairway with Geoff Ogilvy of Australia as he gears up for the defence of his title . Patrick Reed, the self-assured American, came second in the players' unpopularity poll . Watson admitted he had been involved in 'some mess ups' on Tour but said he did not dislike any of his professional peers. 'I had the same question asked to me, so I answered that question,' Watson said. 'I put my name on there too, because I'm not going to call out anybody, there's nobody I dislike on Tour. 'I dislike them if they beat me, but I don't dislike them as a person. 'So I put my own name down there. So one of those names were me; I wrote it down myself. 'Obviously, I've never been in a fight in my life, so if I was in a fight, it was my fault. 'I caused somebody to get angry. So yeah, I wouldn't help myself either.'"
"President Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop to the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica last night while on a visit to the country for a meeting with Caribbean leaders. The first president to visit Jamaica in three decades, Obama arrived in Kingston yesterday evening and was met by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller, U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica Luis Moreno and a dozen other dignitaries. Obama promptly embraced the local color  by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island's most famous son. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica . The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit . On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981, Obama, looking relaxed in shirtsleeves, was shown a trophy room where Marley's Grammys and platinum records were on display. At the same time Marley's hit song 'One Love' played over the loudspeaker. The musician's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre, a photographic gallery, and a gift shop selling T-shirts, posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia. One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star's platinum records and a Grammy award. Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston . The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family . 'What a wonderful tour,' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark. 'I still have all the albums.' Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela's economic clout may be receding. The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008. Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor, the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him, and Antigua's highest mountain officially became 'Mount Obama' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement. Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley's albums . Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security . As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982, Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller, poorer neighbors. The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy, security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom. Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region. From Jamaica, Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions. Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December."
"(CNN)How would you get your nation's president to hear you out? Put your name and number on a mango and hit him in the head with it? No? Then you're not Marleni Olivo, who did exactly that, and in return is getting the new apartment she was asking for, said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Olivo, 54, saw her opportunity when Maduro visited Anzoategui, the state where she lives. Maduro, a former bus driver, drove a bus to a rally Wednesday where he was meeting with supporters. The president had the window open, the better to greet people attending the rally. Olivo had written a message on a mango -- ""If you can, call me,"" -- along with her name and phone number. She got as close as she could and, as the bus passed, she tossed the fruit at Maduro. In a video that has gone viral in Venezuela, Maduro is shown lowering his head when he is hit, just above the left ear. He then calmly picks up the mango and holds it up to the crowd. Later in the evening, the president mentioned the incident in one of his customary live TV broadcasts and displayed the infamous mango as proof. ""Marleni Olivo,"" Maduro said. ""We're going to invite her to my [TV and radio] show, 'In Touch with Maduro.' She had a housing problem, right? And, Marleni, I have approved it already, as part of the Great Housing Mission of Venezuela, you will get an apartment and it will be given to you in the next few hours. Tomorrow, no later than the day after tomorrow, we will give it to you."" Maduro also joked that he had something in common with the mango. The word ""maduro"" in Spanish means ripe. Olivo told local media her intention was to toss the president a note, as others in the crowd were doing. ""I didn't have paper available at that moment,"" she told El Pitazo TV. ""What I had was a mango that I was about to eat because I was hungry."" Maduro's critics are calling the incident a ""manguicidio,"" a play on the words ""mango"" and ""magnicidio,"" a Spanish word meaning assassination of a powerful leader. In Venezuela's extremely polarized political climate, Maduro frequently talks about his belief that the opposition is conspiring to target him for assassination. But the mango-thrower says she had no evil intent. ""My dream is to own a home before I die,"" she told El Pitazo TV, adding that she had been very ill recently, that she suffers from diabetes and hypertension. And now her dream is about come true, a dream that would not have been possible without her boldness and a little help from a tasty mango."

"Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons may have played his last game this season after suffering another injury setback. The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the club's under-21s against Derby on Wednesday evening along with fellow long-term absentee Siem de Jong. However, it is understood he has succumbed to injury once again and it is feared his campaign could be over. Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons has suffered another injury setback and may not play again this season . The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the Magpies' Under 21s against Derby on Wednesday . The Magpies declined to comment, but Aarons' loss would be yet another blow to head coach John Carver, who has seen his side defeated in each of its last five Barclays Premier League games amid a suspension and injury crisis which shows few signs of abating. Midfielder Moussa Sissoko was sent off during Monday night's loss at Liverpool to ensure his own enforced spell on the sidelines just as Carver prepares to welcome skipper Fabricio Coloccini back from a three-match ban. Carver can not call on striker Papiss Cisse, who has three more games to serve of his suspension, while Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett, Massadio Haidara, Cheick Tiote, Aarons and De Jong have all been missing for some time with most having kicked their last ball of the campaign. Newcastle had hoped Aarons' pace and direct approach would give them some fresh impetus with their season having careered to a halt in recent weeks. The exciting winger has made only five senior appearances to date this term, the last of them on November 1 when he was used as a first-half substitute in a 1-0 league win over Liverpool at St James' Park.Â .

"Real Madrid’s La Liga and Champions League chances have been dealt a major blow with confirmation that Luka Modric could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. The Croatian midfielder pulled up in the second half against Malaga on Saturday and tests on Sunday confirmed a sprained ligament in his right knee with a recovery time of between five and six weeks. The news comes as the club wait to assess the full extent of Gareth Bale's calf injury, picked up in the same game. The connection between the former Tottenham pair is an essential part of Carlo Ancelotti's side's chances of picking up silverware this season. Former Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric is helped off the Bernabeu pitch by medical staff . Cristiano Ronaldo was the first Madrid player to go over to Gareth Bale, who picked up an injury on Saturday . Luka Modric hobbles off the Bernabeu pitch have sprained a ligament in his right knee on Saturday . Modric could still be back for the Champions League final but Real Madrid will have to get there without him. On Wednesday when they play the second leg of their quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, poised at 0-0 after the first 90 minutes, they will almost certainly also be without Bale. It’s one year on from his dramatic winner in the Copa del Rey final but Bale, who also scored in the Champions League final and the World Club Cup last year, is likely to be in a race to get back before the Champions League semi-finals on 5-6 May should Real reach them. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . Real Madrid will have Karim Benzema back against Atletico so he will partner Crisitano Ronaldo up front with James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Isco plus whoever Ancelotti calls upon to replace Modric in a midfield four. German international Sami Khedira and former Real Sociedad player Asier Illaramendi are the options. Bale’s absence will be a massive blow for Ancelotti. He said in midweek: ‘Bale was fantastic last season and has been very good this year. He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.’ And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team. The Croatian injured himself towards the end of last year and when he missed three months of football it coincided with the team’s worst run of form. The Welsh forward was forced off and faces a race to be fit for Real's Champions League quarter-final .

"Thierry Henry said the Stadium of Light was the noisiest atmosphere he had ever experienced during Sunderland’s derby win over Newcastle. Six days later, silence reigned. A sorrowful silence as thousands streamed for the exits in the wake of Crystal Palace’s fourth goal inside 14 second-half minutes. Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe can't hide their disappointment following defeat . A shameful silence as Sunderland’s players afterwards absorbed the shock of another embarrassing home collapse. But perhaps most damning was the sad silence of realisation from Dick Advocaat. When asked how concerned he was that the side he has inherited are in danger of the drop, he grimaced for fully 10 seconds before returning: ‘Worried? Yes, very worried.’ And he has every reason to be. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat looks on as Sunderland are dismantled at home by Crystal Palace . The stands emptied during the second-half at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland conceded four goals . Exactly four weeks earlier Advocaat had watched from the comfort of his home in Holland as Sunderland trailed 4-0 at half-time to Aston Villa, a side who had scored just twice on the road all season. On Saturday, he watched from the discomfort of the touchline as Yannick Bolasie trebled his tally for the campaign with a devastating 11-minute hat-trick. The Congolese forward had earlier laid on the opener for Glenn Murray. Palace were ruthless and Alan Pardew, beaten in his last four Tyne-Wear derbies as Newcastle boss, had his revenge. Yannick Bolasie applauds the travelling fans holding the match ball after helping Crystal Palace to victory . Sunderland (4-3-3): Pantilimon 4.5; Jones 5, Vergini 4, O’Shea 3.5, Van Aanholt 5; Rodwell 5, Cattermole 4.5 (Bridcutt 64min, 5), Gomez 4.5 (Johnson 60, 5); Defoe 5, Fletcher 5, Wickham 6. Subs not used: Reveillere, Graham, Coates, Mannone, Buckley. Scorer: Wickham 89. Booked: Rodwell, Cattermole. Crystal Palace (4-4-2): Speroni 6; Ward 6, Dann 7.5, Delaney 6.5, Souare 6 (Kelly 35, 6); Zaha 7.5, McArthur 6.5 (Ledley 69, 6), Jedinak 6.5, Puncheon 7; Bolasie 9 (Sanogo 71, 6), Murray 8. Subs not used: Hangeland, Hennessey, Gayle, Ameobi. Scorers: Murray 48, Bolasie 51, 54, 62. Booked: Dann. Man of the match: Yannick Bolasie. Referee: Anthony Taylor 6. SUPER STAT: Sunderland have now lost the four matches immediately after their Tyne-Wear derby victories. Sunderland, though, had again given a depressing demonstration of how to surrender a football match. When your skipper, John O’Shea, is out-fought for a ball with the odds stacked in his favour — as he was for Bolasie’s second — then you know your problems have permeated the core of the team. Jermain Defoe, derby match winner the previous weekend, played as if he had been issued with an exclusion order from the penalty box. Advocaat said: ‘I can see for myself that we don’t create enough chances even though we play with three strikers. Even when we play with so many up front we don’t create anything and that means there is something wrong in the squad. ‘We showed we can do something against Newcastle but if we carry on performing like this then we have no chance.’ On this evidence, Advocaat is right. Sunderland will only be spared relegation by the shortcomings of others. They are not capable of saving themselves, as they did in miraculous fashion 12 months ago. Given that the season finishes with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea they are now working on a four-game rescue plan. Wilfired Zaha joins an ecstatic Bolasie (left) after the forward produced a stunning hat-trick in the second-half . For Palace and brilliant Bolasie, meanwhile, they are only looking up after four straight wins. And the 25-year-old credited Pardew following his first senior hat-trick. ‘That (goals) is what the manager has been demanding from me,’ he said. ‘He has been putting me right in the middle of sessions, even doing the lay-ups for me. Crystal Palace forward Zaha evades the attention of Sunderland striker Fletcher during the contest . ‘He has put sessions on that have been especially for the strikers, it’s been excellent.’ Pardew enjoyed seeing his side run riot. Murray headed them in front before Bolasie executed three swift breakaways. A league table from Pardew’s time in charge has Palace fifth. And he added: ‘We are a pretty young team and only need to add two or three to the squad and we could be a real force next season.’ As for next season for Sunderland, they can only hope they’re in the same division as Palace. Advocaat shakes hands with opposition manager Alan Pardew knowing his side is in real relegation danger ."
"An obese mother who enjoyed takeaways and boozy nights out has lost more than seven stone after a child on a bus pointed at her and asked whether she was pregnant. Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant . Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: ""Has she got a baby in her belly?""' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs . As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer . 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness . 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her. 'She's like the old Lizzi I used to know as a little girl.'"
"(CNN)For superhero fans, the cup runneth over. Most of us know the members of the Avengers by now: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk and the rest, and the fact that a few more like Quicksilver are joining the cast in the ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" sequel. But there was one character who remained a mystery: the Vision, to be played by Paul Bettany. Thus far, we've only seen his eyes in a trailer. With less than a month to go before the movie hits theaters, Marvel Studios put all the speculation to rest with a poster featuring Bettany as the heroic android, who was a member of the superhero group for many years in the comics. Meanwhile, as many Marvel fans know, Thursday was the eve of the new Netflix series ""Daredevil,"" and after a photoshopped first look at Charlie Cox's iconic red Daredevil suit went out, Marvel put out a video of the real one. Not to be outdone, director Bryan Singer announced a new character for next year's sequel ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" by telling Empire magazine that Ben Hardy would be playing the role of the winged mutant Angel. He even had a photo to share. And Thursday's new super images weren't quite done, because the questions over how Jamie Bell's rocky character The Thing in the rebooted ""Fantastic Four"" movie (out August 7) might look were also finally answered. And he looks ... pretty much like The Thing we already knew (but reportedly, CGI this time). Within 24 hours, we got yet another indication that the superhero trend isn't going anywhere anytime soon (and we didn't even talk about the new photo of Ryan Reynolds' ""Deadpool"")."
"The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock . Apple launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed. For although the Apple Watch is officially going on sale, none of its stores will have them in stock. Instead, consumers willing to shell out between £299 to £13,500 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until June. Usually, Apple launches generate long queues outside stores. But City analysts believe the company feared the queues might be embarrassingly small and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang. In fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations. As a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today. Analysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year. The watch includes a host of personal trackers, including a heart rate monitor, and is being billed as a personal doctor that will help users to lose weight and improve their health. However, Apple also wants it to be seen as style statement and fashion accessory, with customers able to choose from any of 38 variants depending on the case and watch strap. As a result, limited supplies have been given to six designer outlets around the world, which will apparently be sold to a few select customers by appointment today. These include the exclusive Dover Street Market in London's Mayfair, which is understood to have 570 of the watches, although not the gold edition. The launch of the watch into stores is being handled by Apple retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, who is very familiar with the world of designer labels. She was head of the luxury British fashion label Burberry, where she was one of the UK's highest paid women executives, before joining the US company last May. Her recruitment was sweetened with a golden hello of shares worth around £40million. She told Apple staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply. In it she said: 'We know that you have been bombarded with questions from customers. 'Luckily, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We know they are excited about the Watch ...but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc. 'Last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now. 'This was not an easy decision, and I think it's really important to remind every single customer that this is not just a new product for us, this is an entirely new category.' The official Apple UK website states anyone ordering the new watch can expect a delivery date in June, however some might get them before. Apple chief executive Tim Cook pictured giving a presentation on the Apple Watch in San Francisco last month . A spokesman said: 'Our team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on the available supply and the order in which they were received. We know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience.' Stuart Miles, technology expert and founder of website Pocket-lint.com, said: 'I think the watch will follow the same lines of success as the iPad did five years ago. It's an intriguing device that has enough wow factor to pull people in.' But he added that the change in buying process this time - and the online backlog that has already begun - could put some people off. 'The biggest problem Apple looks to be facing, is not if people will buy one, it's whether they are going to be happy to wait until they can get one,' he said. Will Findlater, editor-in-chief of gadget magazine Stuff, said: 'In many ways the Apple Watch is the ultimate gadget. Beautifully made and finished, hugely desirable and capable of a host of clever things, none of which you need, but many of which are nice to have. 'The functionality that could end up most compelling is messaging - the ability to send scrawled drawings, emoticons and even your heart beat direct to another Apple Watch owner feels personal in a way no other message platform does.' He added: 'The one-day battery life and price are the two factors that will put many buyers off. £300 or more is a lot to pay for a first-generation device, especially as Apple will learn a lot about making it better once it's in the market. 'That means the second or third-generation Apple Watch is probably the wiser buy. However, waiting would mean missing out on the fun of living with an entirely new, cutting-edge gadget right now, and for early adopters, that will be too much to bear.' Industry commentators believe the Apple Watch will follow the same lines of success as the iPad (pictured) did five years ago ."

"The mother of a high school student who has been prevented from attending classes as a consequence for not wearing the right style shoes has expressed her outrage over the 'ridiculous' situation. Riley Filmer, 14, turned up for classes wearing new shoes on the first day of term at McClelland College, in Melbourne's south-east, only to be told that the black soft-leather lace-ups did not meet uniform standards. The Year Eight student was prevented from attending her classes for the day, and has not been allowed back into the classroom since the incident, which her mother Anne Parker claims has disadvantaged and excluded her daughter. Riley Filmer, 14, has been prevented from attending classes at her Melbourne high school because her shoes do not meet the strict uniform guidelines . The secondary school's policy outlined in the 2015 Personal Learning Journal states that girls are to wear 'black leather lace-up school shoes (not fashion heels)' for both summer and winter uniforms, a guideline which Ms Parker said Riley's shoes meet. Ms Parker said that after going through five pairs of shoes in four school terms, she decided that her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs. 'Rain, hail, or shine Riley has to walk to catch the bus, and then switch to another bus to get to school because of my work, and so we decided to look into a different type of shoe than the ones we had been buying,' Ms Parker told Daily Mail Australia. 'Is it that big a deal that my daughter has shoes they don't care for? Kids walk and skate, and catch a bus or a train, not every child gets driven to school. The rules need to cater for comfortable and practical shoes,' she said. The rubber-soled soft leather lace-ups were pointed out by a teacher on the first day of term, and Riley was taken to the school's office, where she was offered a pair of shoes from lost property, and remained until the end of the day. Ms Parker was not contacted to let her know that her daughter had been taken out of class, and said that she has had no contact with the principal of the school, Amadeo Ferra, despite Mr Ferra issuing a statement on Thursday reinforcing the uniform guidelines. The secondary school's policy states that girls are to wear 'black leather lace-up school shoes (not fashion heels)', which Ms Parker said the shoes comply to . Ms Parker said  her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs . 'I just can't make sense of this. They've shifted the goal posts on what they are expecting of the uniform. When I spoke to the vice-principal yesterday I was told that her shoes aren't the type of shoes they're looking for, even though they are black leather lace-ups,' she said. Ms Parker was informed that the school was looking for shoes with more of a heel, but has been left baffled as to why her daughter is being punished for a non-existent rule. 'Why has she not been allowed to attend class while this grey area is being cleared up? If I decided to pull her out of school for four days, I would be in trouble. But for some reason they can pull my daughter out of classes simply because they don't like her shoes'. The 14-year-old has not been allowed back into classes since Monday, which Ms Parker said has caused significant issues when it comes to her daughter completing her school work. 'The school said that she hasn't been given an in-school suspension, but I don't know how else to look at it. She can't go to class. What is that if not a suspension?' Ms Parker said. 'She has been allowed to approach each of her teachers at the beginning of the lesson to ask for work, and some have given her work, but some haven't,' she said. 'It's the start term and so she is really struggling to complete work because she's not in class to have things explained to her.' Ms Parker also said that she pointed out to the school that being unable to attend classes and prevented from joining in with her classmates was exclusion, which went against the school's own policy. The school offered to buy Riley a pair of shoes which met the standards of the uniform policy, but Ms Parker said that she had declined the offer as she did not understand why her daughter was not able to wear comfortable shoes that she already owned. Ms Parker said that her daughter was being excluded from classes, which breached McClelland College's own policy on bullying and harassment . McClelland College's principal Amadeo Ferra said that the school was sticking by the uniform policy . Mr Ferra released a statement on Thursday addressing the issue. 'Our students are expected to wear black leather lace-up shoes. Shoes with a flat sole — ‘skate-style shoes’ — are not acceptable,' Mr Ferra said. 'We have done everything to assist the family concerned, including offering the student a pair of appropriate shoes,' he said. 'We still expect the student to wear the appropriate shoes but will be ensuring she receives regular classroom teaching, which is what we have always wanted,' reported The Herald Sun. Mr Ferra said that McClelland College's uniform policy was set by the school council, and involved consultation with the school community. Ms Parker said that she was disappointed and frustrated with the school, and couldn't understand why her daughter's shoes were drawing so much attention when the school had much larger issues. 'I had another parent say to me that she couldn't believe they were worried about school shoes when there are students walking around the local shops in school hours,' she said. 'Other parents have thanked me for sticking up for the kids and not letting the issue be swept under the carpet.' 'It seems trivial and sad when we look at what's going on in society and with kids these days. I just find it ridiculous'. Ms Parker has contacted her local MP, and has also submitted a complaint with the Victorian Board of Education, and hopes to get a response within the next two days. McClelland College has been contacted for comment."
"Samantha Crossland escaped a custodial sentence after the £22,000 she admitted stealing from her employer and friend had been repaid in full . The daughter of a millionaire lottery winning couple who stole over £22,000 from a children’s nursery has escaped jail - after the cash was paid back. Samantha Crossland, 30, was pocketing parents’ fees being paid to the Child’s Play day nursery she worked at in a trusted position. She had been told she faced a custodial sentence unless the money was paid back and Crossland - whose parents made over a million on the lotto - handed back the cash. Nursery owner Lynda Quigley confirmed that the amount stolen - £22,642 - had been paid into her bank account on from an “S. Crossland”. It was not clear whether this was Samantha - or her mother Susan Crossland. Crossland had even been promoted to manager at the nursery by its owner who knew her and trusted her. Much of the money was taken from a cash box on the wall that parents left their fees in. Leeds Crown Court court heard that only Crossland and Mrs Quigley had keys to this. It was only when Mrs Quigley returned to the nursery in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in early 2014, that she became aware of discrepancies in the accounts. In total these came to £22,642. Crossland was arrested and gave four no comment interviews. She later pleaded guilty to one count of theft. The court heard today that Mrs Quigley had received £22,643 via bank transfer on April 22. Crossland, of Mirfield, West Yorkshire was sentenced  to a 12-month community order and 180 hours unpaid work. Recorder Ray Singh said: 'You were in a position of significant trust by Miss Quigley. You were left alone to deal with the money, it is therefore a breach of trust. 'Staff parents and the like were no doubt finding it very difficult to understand what was happening.” Mrs Quigley, who has had the nursery for 14-years, said after the hearing: 'I feel really relieved that I’m finally going to get closure now that the court case has finished and the money taken has been repaid in full. 'I’m happy that justice has been served after what has been a very difficult year. 'But I still have no idea why she did this to me - why a good friend would betray me like this.' Crossland's parents Michael and Susan won more than £1.2 million on the lottery back in July 2008 . The money was stolen by Crossland, pictured,  from the Child's Play nursery in west Yorkshire . Crossland refused to comment on her sentence while leaving court. Crossland’s parents, Susan and Michael, hit the headlines after winning £1.2 million on the lottery in 2008. At the time of their win, mum-of-four Susan said she believed her £1,218,618 windfall was down to her late father Barrie - as she played his numbers each week in the two years since he had died. Speaking in July 2008, she said: She said: 'My win must be fate which is why I saw the feathers and won on his number line. 'During the week before the draw, I was seeing white feathers everywhere and I never know where they come from. 'Just two-days before the win, we were tickling my dog Ruby at home and a white feather just floated down from nowhere and landed on her tummy. I knew it was dad trying to say something. 'I feel he is looking out for me and he would have been so pleased for us. It’s a real shame he isn’t here to share the winnings with us after he helped us to get it.'"

"1. Heavy drinking males: Scientists at Sheffield University have identified six different types of obese person (file image) There are six different types of obese person, scientists have today revealed. The distinction, they hope, will allow for tailor-made treatments to help different obese people combat their weight. Researchers at the University of Sheffield analysed people with a body mass index of 30 or more - a recognised measure of obesity. They found obese people fall into one of six categories: . The scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole, rather treat them according to the 'type' of obese person they are. Dr Mark Green, who led the study, said: 'Policies designed to tackle obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles often target individuals just because they are obese. 'But a focus on just the group as a whole is not very efficient. We are all different and different health promotion approaches work for different people. 'Our research showed that those in the groups that we identified are likely to need very different services, and will respond very differently to different health promotion policies. Scroll down for video . 'In the future, we hope that GPs will keep in mind these six groups when offering advice to their patients.' BMI has long been used to measure individuals in terms of their height and weight, but does not account for variation across other factors such as health, demographic and behavioural characteristics. The team at Sheffield looked at health-related variables, including whether individuals reported conditions like fatigue, pain, insomnia, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or cancer. 2. Young healthy females: The scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole, rather treat them according to the 'type' of obese person they are. The largest cluster was 'younger healthy females' - also the youngest group (file image) 3. The affluent and healthy elderly: This group was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption (file image) Demographic variables accounted for were age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation, while well-being was assessed by asking people how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale of nought to 10. Whether participants smoked and the number of units of alcohol they consumed in the previous week was also taken into consideration. 4. The physically sick but happy elderly: They had a higher prevalence of chronic health problems including high blood pressure (file image) As was whether or not they engaged in active weight management - going to slimming clubs, for example - and whether they made a conscious effort to eat more healthily. Researchers discovered the largest cluster was 'younger healthy females' - also the youngest group. They were the group most likely to display positive health characteristics, and engaged in some healthy behaviours. 'Heavy drinking males' showed similar characteristics, but consumed a high level of alcohol. They were less likely to be managing their weight, though did report above average levels of physical exercise and walking. The 'unhappy anxious middle-aged' group was primarily female, had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Their sense of well-being was relatively low, but they did engage in healthy physical activity and weight management, and had the lowest alcohol consumption. The final three clusters captured different patterns among older people. The 'affluent healthy elderly' was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption. The 'physically sick but happy elderly' group had a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions -including osteoarthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure - but exhibited low levels of anxiety and depression. 5. The unhappy and anxious middle-aged: This group was primarily female, had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression and fatigue (file image) 6. Those with the poorest health: This group was found to be the most deprived, and had the highest prevalence of  chronic health conditions. And they tended not to engage in  healthy behaviours (file image) The final group, made up of those with the 'poorest health', was the most deprived, had the highest prevalence of most chronic health conditions, and tended not to engage in healthy behaviours. It also had the highest average BMI. Researchers said health professionals should assess what group obese patients might fall into and treat them accordingly. For example, for the 'unhappy anxious middle-aged' an intervention involving increasing exercise may need to be mixed with psycho-social counselling, while for those in the 'poorest health', group advice on exercise may not be reasonable and more modest goals may be needed. Meanwhile messages about alcohol reduction could help tackle obesity in young adults. The findings are published in the Journal of Public Health."

"(CNN)The Arizona police officer who slammed into an armed suspect with his patrol car told investigators he thought he was too far to take a shot at the man, so he chose the other option, CNN affiliate KVOA reported Wednesday. Officer Michael Rapiejko ran his car into Mario Valencia in February as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air. Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper. Valencia, who flew through this air, survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day. His lawyer has said police used excessive force and could have killed a man who was obviously unstable. The Marana Police Department has defended Rapiejko, saying deadly force was warranted because the suspect had a rifle, ammunition and was walking toward offices where hundreds of people work. Marana is just northwest of Tucson. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says . KVOA obtained police inquiry tapes on which Rapiejko tells investigators why he chose his car as a weapon. The officer, who has been a cop for more than a decade but joined the Marana Police Department in 2014, said he was 50 yards away from the suspect and worried a missed shot might hit another officer or bystanders. ""There were occupied businesses, and there were two officers at the other side of the street,"" he says on the recording. ""This is what I deem as a lethal force encounter. I have two thoughts that go in my mind: I need to shoot him to stop the threat, or I need to run him over to stop the threat."" Another officer, who was slowing trailing Valencia and ahead of Rapiejko, says on another recording that if a civilian had stumbled upon Valencia, the suspect might have taken a hostage or killed the person. Video of the car striking Valencia sparking nationwide debate on what type of force police should use to go after armed suspects. Many people commended the officer. Some people said the police should have set up a perimeter around the man and talked him into surrendering. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN last week that ""it is miraculous that my client isn't dead."" Valencia, who is in Pima County Jail, is scheduled to appear in court again on May 18. Authorities chose not to charge Rapiejko.

"(CNN)Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle guru, is known for promoting detoxes and health cleanses on her site, Goop.com. But she's now bringing awareness to the difficulties of life on food stamps. In a tweet Friday, Paltrow showcased an array of leafy greens, dried beans and rice, purchased for the amount a person living on food stamps is allotted each week, she explained. The amount of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits a person can get is based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan. The plan estimates how much it costs to buy food, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In this case, Paltrow will be spending just under $30 for groceries. Her participation is part of the #FoodBankNYCChallenge. Celebrity chef Mario Batali, a close friend of the star's, nominated Paltrow and musicians Sting and Deborah Harry for the challenge through a video. The challenge urges participants to use only $29 for all the food a person eats for seven days. ""For one week, walk in someone else's shoes,"" Batali is quoted saying on the Food Bank for New York City's website. ""By truly understanding what our friends and neighbors are going through, we will be better equipped to find solutions."" The #FoodBankNYCChallenge is an attempt to live on a food stamp budget for one week, which translates to $1.38 per meal, according to the site. The effort is in response to recent cuts to food stamps. ""Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,"" the site explains. Organizers hope the challenge will raise public awareness of the struggles for families to afford food while on food stamps."
"Sam Allardyce has warned Brendan Rodgers that putting Raheem Sterling on a bumper new contract could cause a ripple effect across the rest of the Liverpool squad. The West Ham manager feels paying Sterling more than the £100,000-per-week deal he was already offered would lead to the 20-year-old's team-mates demanding more. Yet Allardyce does not blame Sterling, currently on £35,000 a week at Liverpool, for trying to get as much as possible. Big Sam feels there are so few talented youngsters emerging that clubs are willing to pay extraordinary wages to sign any available. Liverpool and England star Raheem Sterling has stalled over signing a new contract at the Anfield club . Sam Allardyce believes that giving Sterling a bumper deal could risk unsettling the other Liverpool players . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) is extremely keen to keep hold of one of the club's best players . 'When the supply is far less than the demand, then you've got very big demands from the youngster, who is a very talented youngster because there are not enough about,' Allardyce said. 'Not just in the country but in Europe in general, if not in the world. 'The demand is out there. The supply is minimal. A lot less than we want it to be. Hence that gives it a value. When that comes around it's very difficult for a football club not to pay that level of finance that they then demand. 'It reflects down the way from there on in, by the fact that the more the money goes up at the top end the more everybody else wants going down below that.' Allardyce feels if a club were to buy the England international, who currently has two years left on his contract at Liverpool, then they would not only be getting a player, but a brand. 'If a player is in his position like Raheem Sterling, then you're going to look at his value,' Allardyce added. 'Not just his value on the pitch but his value in branding. 'You have to remember that we're hitting 950 million viewers every weekend. The agents and his advisers look at the value of that to the football club, and the value of that to him and their brand, and they ask for that sort of money.'

Big Sam was speaking ahead of West Ham's match with the Barclays Premier League's bottom-club Leicester City on Saturday. The game will see Allardyce reunited with Leicester manager Nigel Pearson after they worked together at Newcastle United in 2007. Pearson has been involved in several controversial incidents this season, including grabbing Crystal Palace's James McArthur by the throat and losing his cool with a reporter during a press conference. It added to speculation Pearson will be sacked but Allardyce defended the man that was once a coach under him at St James' Park. 'Nigel was there (at Newcastle) when I arrived and we worked very well together in that short period of time,' Allardyce said. 'I always thought he was management material and I think he left just after I left, then moved into management and has been very successful. 'I suppose in the end Nigel is a very, very, very, very honest man. He says it how it is. Perhaps that's sometimes the wrong thing to do publicly, but he knows who he is. He knows what he wants. He knows how to try to achieve it.' Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson (left) has been involved in a number of controversial incidents this season ."
"Dagenham and Redbridge midfielder Joss Labadie has been banned for six months after being found guilty of a biting offence for the second time in the space of a year. The 24-year-old was last month charged with violent conduct by the FA after he was accused of sinking his teeth into the hand of Stevenage defender Ronnie Henry during Dagenham's 1-0 win at the Lamex Stadium. It came just 12 months after he was banned for 10 matches and fined £2,000 for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks while playing for Torquay. Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie (in yellow) has been banned for six months for biting Ronnie Henry (left) Labadie  appeared at an FA disciplinary hearing on Wednesday and denied any wrongdoing, but was hit by another lengthy ban. A statement on the official Dagenham & Redbridge website said: 'Both the player and the Club are awaiting the written report from the FA hearing before deciding their next steps.' Former West Brom trainee Labadie, who has also played for Shrewsbury, Cheltenham, Tranmere and Notts County during his career, has played twice since the incident at Stevenage on March 28 — in defeats for the Daggers at Shrewsbury and Carlisle. Labadie pleaded not guilty to the violent conduct charge at a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday . The incident between Labadie and Henry occurred during a  League Two clash last month ."
"Notts County have appointed Ricardo Moniz as their new manager just a week after the club announced that he was unable to commit to the role. The former Tottenham and Hamburg coach pulled out of the running due to 'family reasons' at the end of March but on Tuesday moved to Meadow Lane on a three-year deal. The 50-year-old Dutchman has six games to save his new side from relegation into Sky Bet League Two, with the Magpies currently one point from safety. Notts County have appointed former Tottenham and Hamburg coach Ricardo Moniz as their new manager . Moniz has six games to save Notts County from relegation to League Two with the club one point from safety . Notts County have been without a permanent manager since the departure of Shaun Derry on March 23, with Paul Hart and Mick Halsall taking caretaker charge of their recent games. But Moniz, who steered Red Bull Salzburg to Austrian league and cup glory in the 2011/12 campaign, will now take the reins. The club have confirmed that Dave Kevan will be Moniz's assistant, with strength and conditioning coach Mike Edwards and goalkeeping coach Kevin Pilkington remaining in their posts. The League One club have confirmed that Dave Kevan will be Moniz's assistant at Meadow Lane . Magpies chairman Ray Trew told the club's official website: 'As I have said previously, I set out on our search for a new manager with an open mind but with a determination to find someone who would be able to bring a new level of excitement to Notts County. 'I think in Ricardo we have found that because, having spoken to him at length, his footballing philosophy is one of structured attacking play, which I hope is something that our fans will buy into, because I know that when I come to Meadow Lane I want to be entertained, I want to be excited by what I see out there on the pitch. 'Results, of course, are the yardstick by which managers are ultimately judged, but if we can play the sort of football that gets people off their seats and instil in our players the desire to take games to our opponents, I think we can make a real impression in this division. Notts County have been without a permanent manager since the departure of Shaun Derry on March 23 . 'Ricardo has a fantastic reputation within the game, not only for the style of football that he plays, but also his ability to spot and nurture young talent, so I am confident that his appointment will be of benefit to all levels of the club. 'In Dave I have been able to bring in someone who knows this level of football and, perhaps equally importantly, knows this football club. He's a Notts County person and I am delighted that he agreed to return for what I feel is an exciting period ahead for the club. 'The new management team's immediate goal is clear, with survival in League One our short-term aim obviously, but work is already under way to ensure that we have the best possible squad available to make a real impression next season.'"
"Kevin Pietersen has hinted the first chapter of his county comeback could be streamed live to fans. The divisive batsman has re-signed for Surrey this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely England recall, having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. He has not played in the LV= County Championship since 2013 but is set to start the season with the Brown Caps in the hope of turning the selectors' heads and reversing last year's controversial sacking. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey  after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . The 34-year-old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. Pietersen announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers on Easter Sunday, raising the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? #comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '#comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. He clearly feels Graves' words are encouragement enough of a Test recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in the Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison. Coach Peter Moores was less ambiguous. Moores was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008, partially at the behest of Pietersen, whose intervention also cost him the captaincy. Incoming ECB chairman Graves advised that signing for a domestic side would help Pietersen's cause . Alastair Cook (left) was coy on Pietersen's chances of a recall but Peter Moores said he 'isn't on the radar' Moores was previously dismissed as England coach at the behest of Pietersen when he was captain . He was then belittled as a nagging 'woodpecker' in the the batsman's memoir and reconciliation between the two men would appear a stretch. Asked at Gatwick about the situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.' He would, therefore, seem an unlikely viewer of Pietersen's Periscope net session."
"Arsene Wenger insists he isn’t haunted by his decision to back out of signing Eden Hazard in 2012 – even if he does accept the Chelsea attacker is getting better every year. It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger’s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille. Talks got to such an advanced stage that Hazard’s agent discussed the move with Wenger in the Arsenal manager’s house, but the Frenchman ultimately ruled he could not compete financially with Chelsea, who landed this season’s standout player for £32million. Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for £32million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out . Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house . Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille . That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: ‘I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And (I could) not defend it, honestly. ‘It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.’ Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday’s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. He said: ‘It’s very close. Let’s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn’t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. ‘I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. ‘He can turn games when it’s 0-0 and when it’s tight. That’s always a sign of top quality.’ Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez (centre) will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote . Chelsea fans reach out to their star man during last weekend's win against Manchester United ."
"(CNN)Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day, online activity -- blogs, YouTube channels, even social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media. It is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence, though that in itself is liberating. It is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. It is not unique to Asia, but it might seem more pronounced if you live there. Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard. But it still brings resistance, some of it legal, some of it deadly. Let's look at the legal angle first. Amos Yee, the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail Sunday in Singapore, drew international attention for his anti-Lee Kuan Yew harangue. But jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in Singapore. It is part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices. His father has reportedly apologized for his son's behavior, but the younger Yee could face up to three years in jail. Yee is not unique. Another dissident blogger in Singapore, Roy Ngerng, continues to suffer financial and legal pressure, including the loss of his job, because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, of corruption. Ngerng's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the Central Provident Fund, the government's compulsory pension program. Yee and Ngerng are two of many. The Committee To Protect Journalists' file on Singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases, some against politicians, others against citizens simply frustrated with their government. But it is not just Singapore where Internet activity comes under fire: On Monday in Malaysia, with much less of the international attention heaped on Amos Yee, five editors and executives from The Malaysian Insider were arrested over the site's March 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors, known as the Conference of Rulers, had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud, or punishments meted out under Islamic law. In deeply Muslim Malaysia, questions of Islamic faith are a third-rail issue, as is revealing government decisions before they are announced. By far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China, where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers, most of them Uighur or Tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism. But in second place in Asia is Vietnam, where CPJ's most recent prison census showed Vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of December 1. Add one more in late December, Nguyen Dinh Ngoc, a prominent blogger who was arrested for ""law-violating"" after police searched his home in southern Ho Chi Minh City on December 27, and two more in January, Nguyen Quang Lap and Hong Le Tho, arrested on anti-state charges of ""abusing democratic freedoms"" and you can see the pattern. Because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled, mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in Vietnam. Only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in Vietnam, their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013. Both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage. The list could go on, but the reality is that, as CPJ wrote in 2013, across Asia ""governments have curtailed Internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices, including prohibitive laws, heightened surveillance and censorship, and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses."" That is still the policy path being followed by most countries in Asia, and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon. Jailing journalists is one thing, but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another. Since 1992, 11% of journalists killed have died for their work online. Because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the Internet, that proportion can be expected to grow. While most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers, Bangladesh has recently become the exception. On Monday, Washiqur Rahman Babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in Bangladesh in the past five weeks. Blogger Avijit Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured. Both Rahman and Roy had written critically on Islamic matters. The blogger death toll gets higher in Bangladesh if you go back a year or two, and religious beliefs are always involved, and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity. In January 2013, blogger Asif Mohiuddin, who wrote critical commentary on religion, Islamist groups, free speech, and human rights, barely survived after he was stabbed by Islamists. In February 2013, blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, who had written about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups, was hacked to death by members of an Islamist militant group, according to police investigations. Later in 2013, Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy. While arrests were made after those murders, there have been no convictions. The bottom line: Online journalists, operating outside the restraints of mainstream media, have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors. Where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom. Where the rule of law is weak, they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom, if ever, answer to the rule of law."
"Dundee United have hit back at fierce criticism of the board's performance by two leading supporters' groups. Arabtrust and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters Clubs say they are 'shocked' that 25 per cent of £6.3million worth of transfer fees for Ryan Gauld, Andrew Robertson, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. The supporters groups also disputed chairman Stephen Thompson's alleged level of investment in the club. The Dundee United board have hit back at criticism from supporters by pointing to their on-field success . The Tannadice club - already under fire for selling Armstrong and Mackay-Steven to Celtic six weeks before their League Cup final defeat to the Scottish champions - responded by defending their record in a statement. It read: 'All supporters can be assured that the board will continue to implement its professional and comprehensive strategy for the football club. 'This strategy and the related actions of the chairman and board of directors have delivered progress both on and off field. 'On the field the club has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years, qualified for European competition in three of the last four years, finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. 'The current management team and players are also sitting fourth in the Premiership this season with sights firmly set on securing a European qualification place.' The supporters' joint statement expressed concern over the levels of club debts, saying: 'Despite the sales of the four players the board of DUFC does not believe that this is yet sufficient to pay all current remaining debt.' Defending their record on that point, the club statement responded: 'Off field the board has reduced overall debt, including Thompson family loans, from £5.2m in February 2014 to £2.6m while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt. The club debt is projected to be reduced to £1.4m by the end of this year. 'Supporters can rest assured that the board is comprised of individuals that are, without exception, Dundee United supporters. They bring with them a wealth of experience in business. 'At all times, the board acts to promote the success of Dundee United and will continue to do so.' Arabtrust and the Federation also voiced concerns that chairman Thompson was wary of bringing in external investors for fear of seeing his family's shareholding drop below 75 per cent. The most explosive allegation, however, is the claim concerning the commission paid to outside parties – none of whom are understood to be players, agents or other clubs. The supporters' joint statement added: 'We believe this figure to be in excess of £500k. This does not include payments to players, agents or other clubs. When all of these various payments are totalled, over 25 per cent of the £6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club.' United last year announced that a recent debt settlement would see the Bank of Scotland collect a share of transfer fees received before the end of August 2015. A United spokesman said: 'We've been reluctantly drawn into this matter and have no wish to enter a war of words, but the £500,000 figure is an entirely fictitious amount based on an incorrect assumption. At no time was that figure provided to anyone, so it's surprising to see it in the public domain.' Some supporters were angered by the amount of commission that was paid from transfer fees received ."
"While the 3pm slump has most of us reaching for a chocolate bar, the sugar crash that comes afterwards, and the guilt, can ruin the enjoyment. But chocoholics can now get their fix guilt-free, as a raw foodie has developed healthy spins on all the classic chocolate bars. Taline Gabrielian, 33, of Sydney's Northern Beaches has recreated the entire range of chocolate bar favourites, including Mars Bars, Snickers, Bounty, Twix and Cherry Ripe, and published the recipes through her best-selling food app, Hippie Lane. Scroll down for the recipe . Mars mania: Fans of the Mars Bar can now enjoy the guilt-free version, with raw recipes by Taline Gabrielian . Choc-full of goodness: No need to count calories or sneaky this Mars Bar, it's sugar-free, vegan and dairy-free . With 129,000 Instagram followers and the Hippie Lane app consistently sitting in the top three of 'most popular food and drink' apps on iTunes since its release in January, Gabrielian attributes all her  success to the re-imagining of sweet tooth favourites. 'It was definitely my tactic. I thought the best way to grow the business and inspire a healthy lifestyle was to offer people something they understand, that looks and tastes like the real deal,' the mother of two told Daily Mail Australia. Gabrielian, who began stocking raw treats in local cafes and photographing them, only realised the serious demand for her sweet treats when she reached 80,000 followers within a year. Healthy hippy: Taline Gabrielian said her choc bars satisfy her, even though she grew up on Nutella and Milo . Twix treats: 'I always crave something after dinner, so these Twix bars still give me the same satisfaction' 'They just loved  that I was portraying healthy versions of the chocolates they knew and loved. They were commenting saying ""does it really taste like a Mars Bar?,"" and basically just wanted a piece of the pie,' she said. While her app has 50 recipes in total, the classic top five favourite bars are by far her most popular, according to Gabriel. But she says her mint slice, caramel and choc cheesecake are also go down a treat too. While the chocolates are all classified as raw, vegan, refined sugar-free and dairy-free, Gabriel assured DMA that this in no way means 'fun or taste-free', people are sold by her recipes. Cherry on top: Gabriel recreated the classic cherry ripe bar for those who like a fruity take on chocolate . 'I began competitions early on (on her Instagram) to remake my treats and convince them it's the real deal and the recipes work. And they loved them, saying 'this is the best peppermint slice I've ever tried and knocking on my door wanting more.' Gabriel shares her top substitutes to eat healthy sweet treats... 1. Swap sugar for... rice malt syrup . 'It's derived from brown rice and is milled down until it becomes syrup.' 2. Swap caramel for... nut butters . 'I will mix almond butter with tahini, coconut oil and dates.' 3. Swap flour for... nut meal . 'When making a biscuit base I like to use a mix of walnuts and almond meal' 4. Swap chocolate for... cacao powder . 'I make chocolate by mixing cacao powder, coconut oil and maple syrup.' 5. Swap butter for... coconut oil . As a self-proclaimed chocoholic who grew up on a diet of Milo and Nutella, Gabriel knows what those with a sweet tooth expect, but ever since she converted to healthy versions, she's never looked back. 'I always crave something after lunch or dinner, I get a sugar rush - we all need it. But I still get the same feeling having one of my Twix bars.' 'Once  in blue moon I will try a  normal chocolate bar again and it’s sickly sweet. But once you cut all the bad sweets and find healthy replacements there's no reason to go back.' For Gabriel, her main criterion for all her chocolate bars are that they are beautiful tasting, using simple ingredients,easy to make, familiar to her followers and have a 'feel good' taste factor. New to the raw baking scene? Rest assured, Gabriel said all her recipes are easy - all it requires is stocking up on a pantry of new ingredients. While she admits some of the recommended  swaps like coconut oil, rice malt syrup and cacao can be expensive to begin with, once you have them, they will be on high rotation - so you get your money's worth.

"A pregnant woman was saved after her partner dived under the capsized boat they were in to retrieve an emergency flare. The woman had been left in the water clinging to the hull of their overturned trimaran in the English Channel yesterday. Her partner had ensured she was safe, then tied a rope around himself, before diving under the vessel to locate the flare. The pregnant woman and her partner (pictured waiting to be rescued) were stranded off the coast of Kent after their trimaran overturned yesterday . The alarm was raised after a man spotted the couple in the water a mile from Dungeness Point, Kent, at 3.30pm – and a rescue boat was sent to help them. The HM Customs cutter Valiant, which was on the water nearby, and was able to locate the upturned vessel within minutes and spotted a red flare. A Coastguard spokesman said that the cutter stood by the vessel, ensuring the safety of those in the water, until an RNLI lifeboat from Dungeness arrived to pick the couple up from the water and take them ashore. They were taken to the William Harvey Hospital by the rescue helicopter from RAF Watisham. The spokesman said the pair were 'cold and shaken by the ordeal' but unharmed. The alarm was raised after a man spotted the couple in the water a mile from Dungeness Point, Kent . Bob Giles, Dover Coastguard Watch Manager said: 'The couple were thrown into the water after their vessel capsized. 'Both were wearing lifejackets and the man ensured that his partner was safe, then tied a rope around himself and dived under the vessel to retrieve a flare so that he could alert rescuers to their position. 'Because they had AIS (automatic identification system) on board they were easy to locate and so were rescued quickly. 'The member of the public who made the first call to the Coastguard did exactly the right thing by calling 999 and asking for the Coastguard. It meant that we were able to get rescuers to the scene within minutes of the vessel capsizing.'"
"A man killed more than 1,000 dogs in Russia  as revenge as he believed the strays were responsible for giving him tuberculosis, a trial heard. Danila Kislitsyn told police  it was his duty to eliminate dogs from the streets around Vladivostok as they posed a threat to people and needed to be wiped out. The 31-year-old would travel around the south-eastern Russian city using poisoned sausages and setting traps to kill  strays and occasionally even people's pets. Danila Kislitsyn (pictured at his trial) has been found guilty of killing 1,000 dogs by giving them poisoned sausages . Officials heard the attacks were revenge as he blamed the animals for him contracting tuberculosis several years previously which had left him in a weakened state. He was arrested as part of a campaign by animal-rights activists who had spent two years monitoring Kislitsyn who would sometimes kill as many as a dozen dogs a day. Kislitsyn had to be sent for psychiatric tests ahead of the trial but was found fit to stand. But animal charities were furious when Judge Olga Yerokhina handed Kislitsyn a fine of just £200. The trial heard that Kislitsyn, pictured with a police officer at his trial, claimed it was his duty to eliminate stray dogs from the streets saying they posed a threat to people and needed to be wiped out . Judge Olga Yerokhina sentenced the 31-year-old, who also believed dogs were to blame for him contracting tuberculosis, to pay just £200 for the canine genocide . Activist Sarah Pirogova from the charity Animal Defender said: 'He was responsible for a dog genocide in his neighbourhood, sometimes a dozen bodies of dead dogs could be spotted on the streets in single day. 'He says he only targeted strays but very often people's pets were also poisoned after eating a piece of sausage that he had laced with poison.' Activists tested the sausages and found that not only were they poisoned, they also contained tablets designed to stop the dogs vomiting so that they could not throw up the lethal food. She added: 'We tried to confront him about it but he was extremely violent and would use spray before running off, so we finally decided to hand a report to police. 'We are disappointed with the result but hope that he will not want to pay another fine and will now stop what he has been doing.'"
"Oldham Athletic have signed Ronaldo. But fans of Manchester United fear not - the League One club have not snaffled their old boy from the mighty Real Madrid. The man in question is 16-year-old Ronaldo Brown who has joined the Latics after being released by Liverpool. Like his namesake, the teenager has explosive pace and plays on the wing. Ronaldo Brown (left), pictured on tour of the Nou Camp in Barcelona, has signed for Oldham Athletic . The 16-year-old  is named after Brazil's former striker Ronaldo, who is pictured scoring in the 2002 World Cup . But he is actually named after the original Brazilian Ronaldo, rather than Portugal star Cristiano. Football-mad mum Denise, 38, chose the name because of her love of the Brazil side - and added that Ronaldo has a twin brother called Rivaldo. Denise, from Fallowfield, Manchester, explained: 'I love football and the boys were born in 1998 - the year of the World Cup. I liked the Brazil side so I named them after Ronaldo and Rivaldo. 'They also have a younger sister called Trezeguet after the French player (David).' Long-suffering Oldham fans, whose team has remained in League One for 18 years, can look forward to one day seeing Ronaldo strutting his stuff at Boundary Park. An Oldham source joked: 'With a new stand about to open we thought we would make a marquee signing to mark the occasion.' Young Brown also has a brother called Rivaldo, after the former Barcelona and AC Milan player . Oldham's newest signing also has a younger sister called Trezeguet, named after the former French striker ."
"David Cameron has made no secret of the fact that he gets broody around babies, but his wife Samantha has ruled out adding to the family in Number 10. In another joint interview on the election campaign trail, the couple were insistent that they are not planning more children, with Mrs Cameron revealing her doctor has told her: 'No way, Jose.' She was pregnant throughout the 2010 campaign, and gave birth to their fourth child Florence in Cornwall after she arrived weeks early. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has ruled out having another baby, days after she and husband David cooed over seven-week-old Regan on a visit to Chorley, Lancashire . Baby talk has never been far from the couple's mind as they have campaign across the country . Baby talk has never been far from the couple's mind as they have campaigned across the country. On Friday Mr Cameron celebrated his emergence from the TV leaders' debate unscathed with a visit to promote help for first time buyers. The couple cooed over seven-week-old Regan as they meet her parents, Robert Arron and Kelly Jeffers at a housing development in Chorley, Lancashire. Mr Cameron was heard quipping: 'Come on darling, maybe another one?' The Prime Minister, already a father of four, later admitted he could not help thinking about having more children when he was around young babies. On a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday, Mrs Cameron, 43, pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed, and said: 'I normally just drink this when I'm pregnant' Campaigning in Cornwall, Mr Cameron told House magazine: 'Definitely, we are not having another baby.' Their fourth child Florence was born in the county in 2010 . David Cameron and his wife Samantha relax in Downing Street by watching Channel Four hit Gogglebox, the pair have admitted. The Prime Minister said the popular show was 'a very clever programme'. But Samantha went further, reeling off her favourite characters filmed watching television. She said she 'loved' Scarlett Moffat, the quick-witted northerner who become a cult figure over her sharp put downs caught on camera. Mrs Cameron said: 'I like the daughter in Newcastle. She's so funny, I love her, she's hilarious. I really think she's great. The Siddiquis are good as well.' After sympathising with the couple about sleepless nights he said: 'Whenever I see a small baby I feel broody, but don't worry, nothing is going to happen on that front.' Then on a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday, Mrs Cameron, 43, pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed, and said: 'I normally just drink this when I'm pregnant.' The Tory leader - who recently ruled out the couple having a fifth child - quickly interjected: 'That is not an announcement!' Now they have moved to rule out categorically any idea that they might add to their brood. Campaigning in Cornwall, Mr Cameron told House magazine: 'Definitely, we are not having another baby.' Mrs Cameron agreed: 'We are definitely not.' She then added: 'The doctors have said 'no way, Jose'.' Mr Cameron chipped in: 'That's another story, darling… But anyway. No, we are not having any more. The last one was born not ten miles from where we are now.' Mrs Cameron gave birth to Florence in the middle of a family holiday to Cornwall in August 2010. The Prime Minister drove with his wife to hospital for what they believed would be a routine check-up. But four hours later he was by her side when she gave birth by caesarean section to their 6lb 1oz 'unbelievably beautiful girl'. It is believed Mr Cameron scrubbed up - wearing a gown and cap to reduce the chances of infection - for the delivery, which was three weeks early. The birth, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, came a year after the death of the Camerons' six-year-old son Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy. The couple also have a nine-year-old son Elwen and 11-year-old daughter Nancy."
"A gang of eight dug a 50m underground tunnel in an attempt to steal the ancient treasures inside a 1,400-year-old temple. The real-life tomb raiders began their daring plan by renting a restaurant across the road from Guanghui Temple in Zhengdin County, North China at the start of February. And while serving snacks to the public at the front of the building, a team on the inside was hard at work with shovels, ladders, and power drills - digging their way towards the temple's famous Hua Pagoda. Audacious plot: A seven-metre deep tunnel, which led to a 50m-long underground passage, was discovered by police when they raided the gang's property - across the road from Guanghui Temple . Historical site: The temple dates back to the Tang Dynasty and the Hua Pagoda (pictured) is nationally protected . The Criminal Investigation Bureau was tipped off about the group's audacious plan at the beginning of March and a task force was assigned to the case, reports People's Daily Online. After two days of investigation, police officers located the tunnel and were able to determine its source. They launched a sting operation four days later and five gang members were arrested - all of who confessed to plans to steal artefacts beneath the pagoda. The gang was just 20 metres away from breaching the Hua Pagoda when they were caught. Evidence of plan: Dozens of bags of earth dug up by the gang during their tunnelling were also found by police . Police questioning revealed that the gang's leader is a man named Zhang from Tianjin, North China. Zhang is a known artefact thief and his associates have also been involved in similar crimes in the past. They were able to hide their construction equipment from the rented property's landlord for more than a month - as it's thought they began digging around the Chinese New Year. After removing a board on the restaurant's floor, police discovered a seven-metre-deep tunnel that opened into a passage leading towards the Hua pagoda located 70 metres away. Almost succeeded: The gang had dug 50 metres towards the Hua Pagoda and were just 20 metres away from breaching it when they were foiled by police . Secret underground lair: The tunnel was around 50 metres long when the criminal gang was caught on March 6 . The tunnel was around 50 metres long when the gang was caught on March 6. Five were arrested and three people are still on the run. Guanghui Temple was built in Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) and renovated in the five Dynasties (908-960 AD). It was destroyed during the war in late Qing Dynasty and the pagoda was the only monument remained intact. The Hua Pagoda is included in the Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level (MHCSPNL) in 1961. Known to police: The gang's leader, Zhang, who was arrested, has a history of artefact theft . Concealed: The gang were able to hide their construction equipment from the rented property's landlord for more than a month . Raided by police: Five men were arrested following a tip-off, but three of the gang are now on the run ."
"Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel has rejected rumours linking him with a move away from Anfield by declaring he won't be leaving the Premier League side. The Slovakia international has made over 200 league appearances for the Reds since arriving in 2008 but has recently been linked with a summer switch switch to Wolfsburg and Napoli. However, Skrtel has rejected a potential move elsewhere and has said his future remains at Liverpool despite his contract expiring in 2016. Martin Skrtel (left) has been linked with a move to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg and Serie A outfit Napoli . The Liverpool defender played in his side's 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday . 'I am not leaving anywhere. Not to Wolfsburg nor to Naples,' he told the Liverpool Echo. Liverpool have endured yet another disappointing campaign this season and are expected to have a clear-out in the summer as they target silverware. But Skrtel's agent Karol Csonto has confirmed it's unlikely the 30-year-old will leave Anfield as he prepares to finalise a new contract. 'The only offer which is lying on Martin Skrtel’s table right now is the extension of his contract from Liverpool,' he said. 'We have been working on the details, and we will be finalising it soon. 'It is not true that he has some offer from the German club. I don’t know anything even about their interest.' Skrtel, pictured above battling with Villa striker Christian Benteke at Wembley, has rejected the rumours .

"England Under 21 captain Jack Butland has revealed voting for team-mate Harry Kane as this season's PFA Young Player of the Year and hopes the Tottenham hotshot can help him emulate goalkeeping skipper Iker Casillas at the European Championship in the Czech Republic this summer. Butland joined his England manager Gareth Southgate and former World Cup legend Michael Owen at St George's Park on St George's Day as around 35 local schoolchildren from the east Midlands were put through their paces by FA skills coaches at England's plush headquarters. The 22-year-old Stoke City goalkeeper is bidding to be the first England captain to lift the European Under 21 championship since Dave Sexton's team won the trophy in 1984 and Kane is expected to be a big part of their team as they attempt to end 31 years of hurt. Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland has reveled he voted for Harry Kane to win PFA Player of the Year . England U21 captain Jack Butland joined manager Gareth Southgate at St George's Park on Thursday . England U21 boss Southgate demonstrates a drill as 35 local school children were put through their paces . FA chief Greg Dyke has said that Kane's agent had called him to say the Spurs striker wanted to be part of the Three Lions team in June even though he has to go to Australia first for a post-season friendly with his club. On his decision to vote for Kane for the PFA award, Butland said: 'For someone who hadn't previously been given a lot of opportunities, he's been phenomenal. He's come out of nowhere and shown what he's about. 'He has constantly been 100 per cent driven and his finishing is among the best I've seen even though he is young. 'For me, there's not a player of the same age near him.' Kane took his tally of goals to 30 for the season with this strike against Newcastle last Sunday . Butland hopes Kane can fire the young Lions to European Championship glory this summer . Butland was part of the ill-fated England side that crashed out of the Under 21 finals at the group stages two years ago, though he did help the Under 17s win their European Championship in 2010. He said: 'With no World Cup or Olympics, it's a chance to grab peoples attention and show there is hope if you like and that there are good players coming through. 'With the incredibly gifted players we have in this country, we need to produce at a higher level. Players like myself, Nathaniel Chalobah and Nathan Redmond experienced tournament football and won it with the Under 17s and that should help massively. Kane has declared that he wants to play in the tournament in the Czech Republic this summer . 'It can bring a calming influence to the group, we will be able to to give a few words of advice here and there and give people an idea of what to expect.' It is unusual for a goalkeeper to be captain but Dino Zoff (1982) and Casillas (2010) led their country to World Cup wins. 'I dreamed of winning the trophy in the last tournament but it didn't go well then. The motivation has been even stronger to produce something this time as a team and do ourselves proud. Butland wants to emulate Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas by captaining his side to tournament glory . 'It has to be the dream, and to lift the trophy would be a huge honour. Casillas has done it, as a Spain captain he has lifted everything. Whether I was captain or not, lifting the trophy would be incredible.' England's squad for the finals will be announced on June 2. Their first match is on June 18."
"These adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind-hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams. The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried away in a Jack Russell's mouth - are doing better than ever after they were taken in by retired farmer Pauline Kidner. Nursed originally on milk form bottles custard creams were introduced into their diet slowly to see whether the cubs were ready for food. Scroll down for video . The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried by a dog - are doing better . Nursed originally on milk, custard creams were introduced to see whether the cubs were ready for food . 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe,' Pauline said . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at the Secret World centre, but Pauline, who runs charity Secret World, says they're growing at an astonishing rate. The 65-year-old, from Somerset, said: 'When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g, now they're 1.1kg, you can almost see them growing.' 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe, we can't risk any getting in their lungs, but they're now on normal bottles. 'Little Star came from Derbyshire, she was brought into someone's kitchen by their Jack Russell dog, it was very lucky he didn't hurt her, she'd been born two days earlier; her umbilical was still attached . 'The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so unfortunately it died within 24 hours . Pauline explained to have two badger cubs picked up by dogs in a short space of time is unusual. 'One cub a year is brought in when dogs get down in the set,' she said. The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so it died within 24 hours . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at centre . Jack Russels have an instinct for digging and going down holes and are traditionally used in badger baiting. However, there is no reason to suspect the illegal blood-sport was to blame for the death of this cub. 'Then we had another called Vogue come up from Cornwall, we called her that because was picked up in the village Vogue near Redruth,' Pauline said. 'Then lastly the third came in three weeks ago, that one's from near Cheddar in Somerset, we called him Scrumpy, because of the cider context . When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g - carers have watched them grow to 1.1kg . They're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, then they might be moved on to solids by the carers . 'We've been keeping Scrumpy separate as he's older than the two girls. Once they start to mouth things, they start playing with each other, pulling ears, Scrumpy can get a bit rough though.' 'They're still on bottles now, we've started putting in custard creams to see if they're interested, then we might move them on to solids. 'They're in the cubby hole in my kitchen now.' The aim is to release the animals back into the wild once they're strong enough. They're all vaccinated against Bovine TB, before they reduce human contact. Pauline said: 'We'll add another two to the group, we'll keep them together before release in autumn. 'When they're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, they go down to the Millie Block, which is a separate building. 'After that they turn nocturnal, we feed them at night, then it's on to glassed enclosures when we just throw the food over to them and get them to revert to wild.' 'Sadly if we can't release them, we do have to put them to sleep, which is why we reduce human contact like that.' After they move to their nocturnal sleep rhythm they will be put in glass enclosures and then released ."
"An investigation has been launched at a £33,000-a-year school after students were taught the wrong exam text. Students at Wellington College, in Berkshire, spent the last year studying a different classic book for their imminent AS-level exam. The mistake only came to light when mock papers arrived and no exam questions related to the taught text. Prestigious: A spokeswoman for the school, which charges £33,000-a-year, said parents had been satisfied by the prompt actions of the school after staff discovered they had been teaching the wrong English text . Now pupils will have to cram their studying into just a few weeks with extra lessons put in place by the school. Sources close to the school, which proudly boasts to be the Best Public School in the Tatler Schools Guide 2014 on its website, said students were left devastated by the blunder. The mistake is believed to have occurred when a teacher changed a text on a spreadsheet without notifying other staff. According to The Sun, the college, whose alumni includes Will Young, Rory Bremner and Made in Chelsea's Caggie Dunlop, apologised for the error but would not name the works of literature involved. Stumped: Students at the posh school are said to be upset by the blunder which has seen nearly a year of hard work go to waste (file photo) A spokeswoman said: 'Only one AS-level English text was wrong out of several. This happened two months before the exam is due to take place. 'A programme of extra lessons was immediately put in place. Students and parents expressed satisfaction with the prompt way the school addressed this. 'The school is running an investigation to see what has happened. No teacher has been sacked. Wellington College is sorry this mistake happened.'"
"The ECB are not living up to their promise of fresh transparency under a new regime by keeping secret the job description for the director of England cricket. The confidential details were sent by email to potential candidates for the post, front-runners for which are former England captains Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart. But the work parameters will not appear on the ECB website or that of headhunters Sports Recruitment International, as would be the normal procedure. ECB chairman Colin Graves has released very few details of the new director of cricket role for England . Former England captain Andrew Strauss (pictured here in 2011) is among the front-runners for the job . It is understood the ECB, who say there will be a proper recruitment procedure, don't want any publicity about the job specification. It might well be altered in various ways during the interview process so their chosen man is happy with the scope of his responsibilities. It is not expected that the new appointment will have to go to every England game. That will please head coach Peter Moores, who talked of the danger of having too many voices in the dressing room after the Antigua Test. But the cricket director will have the main say over coach and captain and set the overall playing strategy. Sports psychiatrist Steve Peters, who is credited with having helped Jonathan Trott recover from situational anxieties well enough for him to return to the Test arena, talked briefly this week about how he is aiding the England batsman. England star Jonathan Trott has overcome situational anxieties following work with psychiatrist Steve Peters . Peters, before giving a lecture on his role as undergraduate dean of the University of Sheffield medical school, said he wasn't equipped to give guidance on the technical batting problems that led to Trott's two failures in Antigua. But he concentrates on ensuring, through Skype sessions, that Trott is in the best state of mind to succeed while being able to put any cricket setback into proper perspective. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho appears to have enjoyed yet another big payday by fronting a Jaguar promotion of their new car supply deal for the Wimbledon Championships. Mourinho, who was shown around the All England Club by chairman-in-waiting and fellow Jaguar ambassador Tim Henman, is a tennis fan who goes to the World Tour finals at the O2 and counts Rafa Nadal as a friend, even inviting him to Chelsea matches. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has begun fronting a new promotional campaign on behalf of Jaguar . It has emerged that Keith Pelley, the Canadian media mogul chosen as chief executive of golf's European Tour, was not the only non-European in the running. So was the second choice, and there was also an American on the short-list. The message seems to have been that the Tour didn't want to antagonise the rest of Europe by appointing another Brit following the long, successful reigns of Ken Schofield and George O'Grady. However, Pelley, despite his lack of golf knowledge, is seen as a good appointment, mainly because of his TV rights acumen. Keith Pelley (right) O'Sullivan going to pot? Five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, who has suffered from depression and missed most of the 2012-13 season with personal issues, doesn't seem to be in the best frame of mind ahead of this year's World Championship judging by a call he made while on the London-Sheffield train last Saturday. O'Sullivan leans across the table as he lines up a shot during the first round of the World Championships . The Rocket, who leads debutant Craig Steadman 7-2 in his first-round match, was overhead saying that he wasn't happy and was ready to retire again. O'Sullivan said in hearing of around 10 passengers travelling in the same first-class carriage: 'It's no good. I don't need any of this. I've got my Eurosport work, I've got money. I only came back to revive my career.

"A father has admitted killing his 13-year-old son by giving him a morphine tablet when the boy complained that he was feeling ill. Kevin Morton gave his son Kye Backhouse an extremely strong painkiller, a court heard - a mistake which he says he will 'have to try and live with it for the rest of my life'. He could now face jail after pleading guilty to manslaughter over the teenager's death at Preston Crown Court. Tragedy: Kevin Morton, right, has admitted killing his son Kye Backhouse, left, by giving him morphine . 'Happy-go-lucky' Kye was found dead at his home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria in October last year. A previous court hearing was told that Morton, 49, gave his son a super-strength morphine tablet because he was feeling unwell. But police and ambulance were later called to the flat, where Kye was found dead and Morton was arrested after admitting he had given his son the painkiller. He confessed to his actions in a Facebook post in December, writing: 'I loved my little boy more than anyone in the world. Death: Kye, 23, complained of feeling unwell before his father gave him the strong painkiller . 'I gave him a tablet by mistake that was too strong for him, it's my fault - I have to try and live with it for the rest of my life but it was an accident.' After Kye's death, his family released a statement paying tribute to the schoolboy. 'The family is devastated at the sudden loss of Kye,' they said. 'He was the most amazing and much-loved young man that anybody could wish to meet - he made everyone around him smile every day and even now with him gone, he is remembered with a smile. 'The emptiness Kye has left in all our lives can only be understood by people who knew and loved him. We are so very proud of him and miss him deeply. 'We cannot even begin to express our feeling of loss - we ache to hold you once more. He was a kind and loving son, brother, grandson, cousin and nephew and a friend to many. 'Kye has left a big hole in the family and things will never be the same again.' During the latest court hearing, Morton hung his head as his barrister James Heyworth said his client made 'full and frank admissions' in police interviews. He was released on bail ahead of sentencing in June, but was warned that he is likely to face jail after pre-sentence reports are prepared for the court. Judge Anthony Russell QC told Morton: 'You have pleaded guilty to a very serious offence. 'As you appreciate, the likely outcome of this case is a custodial sentence. But it's important for the court to have as much information about you as possible in order to assess both the nature of the sentence and the length of it.'"
"Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport’s finest accomplishments. The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986 . Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009 . Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters . ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’ It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National . ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011 . Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament . ‘It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’ Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‘There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,’ said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf’s Mount Rushmore."
"A star college athlete and a classmate from Alabama's Troy University have been suspended after authorities discovered a cellphone video that allegedly shows them sexually assaulting a woman at a beach while a large crowd of spring-break revelers watches. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen described the graphic video as the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' he had ever seen likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. He says the footage shows several men surrounding an incapacitated woman on a beach chair. Delonte Martistee, 22, of Bainbridge, Georgia, and Ryan Calhoun, 23, of Mobile, Alabama, were charged with sexual battery for the incident believed to have occurred between March 10 and 12. Delonte Martistee, 22 (left), and Ryan Calhoun, 23 (right), have been officially suspended from Troy University in the wake of sexual assault claims . The two were arrested this week after police uncovered cellphone footage of the two of them assaulting an unconscious girl at the Spinnaker Beach Club in Panama City, Florida last month . The video allegedly shows hundreds of people gathered around the girl as the men violate her while she lays on a beach chair. The unidentified victim believes she was drugged before the incident. Above, the beach behind Spinnaker is seen on April 12, 2015 . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case and additional arrests are expected. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun, of Mobile, Alabama pictured above in a picture from Facebook. Officials say they more arrests are expected . Above, a view of the Spinnaker Beach Club during a spring break party . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' The investigation related to the incident is ongoing."
"A video has emerged which appears to show a deputy hitting a heavily pregnant Iraq war veteran on her back during an arrest. Deanna Robinson, of Quinlan, Texas, was 38 weeks pregnant when she says she was struck at least three times at her parents' home.

There are photos of the alleged injuries on a Facebook group set up by friends about her case . The March 4 video shows a group of people in the kitchen of her parents' home - her mother is holding her son as two officers struggle with Robinson. Her parents' home surveillance system records in intervals - it captured about 30 seconds of the confrontation. Robinson, 38, is cornered and there are two officers behind her - she is not clearly visible, but is near the kitchen counter. In the video, which was posted to Facebook and YouTube, Robinson can be heard screaming 'Let go, you know I'm pregnant.' But then one of the officers appears to hit her with his fist and his arm raises again. The camera cuts off, but Robinson, who received the Air Force's highest honor, the Airman's Medal, after helping drag several soldiers from a burning plane in Iraq, insists he struck her about three of four more times.

On Monday Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks posted a statement on the department's Facebook page after the video went viral . She says CPS were called as she and her husband - with who she says she has a rocky relationship -  had an argument at their home. She says she went to her parent's home with her toddler son, but her stepson, who has cerebral palsy and is in a wheelchair, told his teacher about the incident -  who in turn reported it to CPS. On March 3, CPS investigators removed her three stepchildren - ranging in age from six to nine - from their home. Then Robinson received a call from a CPS investigator telling her that he wanted to talk to her about the incident as well as check up on her toddler son. But she says when they arrived, they told her they were they to take her son. She says she stepped in front of her son as she tried to close the door and put her hands up as she screamed 'No, you're not touching my kid.' Robinson says they pushed past her as she demanded to see the paperwork and handcuffed her. Her toddler is currently in temporary CPS custody. Levi is being cared for by her parents. On Monday Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks posted a statement on the department's Facebook page after the video went viral. It read: 'I have become aware of an internet allegation accusing one of my deputies of improper actions. 'I have initiated an administrative investigation to determine if any policy violations occurred.'"
"The shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in corporation tax . Ed Balls yesterday opened the door to a tax raid on businesses, which critics warn would endanger the economic recovery. In a TV interview, the shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in the main rate of corporation tax if Labour form the next government. He was also evasive about the 40p rate of income tax, into which millions of people have been dragged in recent years, saying he was unsure how quickly the threshold could be raised. Businesses are already concerned about Labour’s stated plans not to cut corporation tax – paid by all large firms on their profits – as the Tories have vowed to if they win office. The main rate has been brought down under the Coalition from 28 per cent to 21 per cent. Asked if he would raise it, Mr Balls would only commit to keeping the main rate ‘the lowest in the G7’ group of countries. This leaves room to raise it up to 26.5 per cent, the level which is imposed in Canada. When it was suggested Labour could levy a rate of ‘24 per cent or 25 per cent’, he did not rule it out, simply saying: ‘We need to make sure we back businesses ... we will keep our rates low.’ John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, warned last week that Labour’s plans to intervene in markets, such as the energy market, and their ‘signals on corporation tax are a cause for concern’. He added that any rise in business taxes would ‘undermine progress to make the whole tax system more competitive and send the wrong signal to firms of all sectors and sizes.’ Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said the prospect of a business tax rise was a ‘clear threat to working people’s future economic security’. He said: ‘It’s clear Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are leaving the door open to a damaging tax rise that risks costing jobs, risks costing investment and risks the economic recovery.’ The Right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies think-tank has said raising corporation tax to 24 per cent gradually over the next five years would cost nearly 100,000 jobs by the end of the Parliament. Labour say by keeping corporation tax at the current rate, they can freeze business rates for 1.5million small firms. The main rate has been brought down from 28 per cent to 21 per cent under the coalition with the Tories vowing to lower corporation tax if they win the Election . Lloyds bank shares on offer for all . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year, David Cameron pledged yesterday. In the latest Tory attempt to revive the free market spirit of the 1980s, millions of small investors willing to spend £250 or more would be given priority access to shares still owned from the 2008 bank bailout. If the party wins the election, the sale would begin with a publicity drive similar to the ‘Tell Sid’ adverts that pushed the 1986 privatisation of British Gas. The plan would see up to £4billion of Lloyds shares sold off at a discount of at least 5 per cent, with individual investors allowed to spend up to £10,000. To counter any claims of a ‘get rich quick’ sell-off, buyers who keep the shares for a year would be rewarded with a loyalty bonus of one extra free share for every ten they hold. The sale would also recoup billions for the Exchequer to pay off some of the country’s vast national debts. Yesterday the Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show this would be the first time there had been such an offer for individual investors. ‘The taxpayer put billions into these banks and I want to get the money back,’ he said. ‘At the same time I think having people being able to own shares in a healthy, successful British bank is the sort of country we should be building.’ Labour said the Tories had announced the sell-off policy seven times already – including before the last election. Lib Dem Danny Alexander said the idea had been rejected over the past five years ‘because it’s not been clear that we’d be able to get the money back for the taxpayer’. Lloyds was bailed out with £20billion of taxpayers’ money in 2008, leaving it 43 per cent state owned. The Government still owns £12.5billion of shares, which were worth 78.7p each on Friday – compared to the 73.6p paid by Gordon Brown."

But, despite scoring 31 goals for Liverpool in the Premier League last season, Suarez admitted the prospect of proving himself in Barca's vaunted attack was intimidating. 'When I arrived I was timid with Messi and Neymar but they just said to me to play as I had done at Liverpool. ‘Now I feel fine off and on the pitch and we have a good time together,' Suarez told a news conference on Monday.

"The familiar brown signs are set up to show tourists where to find an area’s finest attractions. So visitors to Dornoch’s golf course or the Sutherland town’s historic cathedral were surprised instead to be pointed in the direction of some toilets, the local GP... and an abattoir. And even if bewildered tourists did suddenly fancy a trip to the slaughterhouse, they would discover it is in the process of being demolished. On a visit to the Scottish town of Dornoch, tourists are pointed towards the local slaughterhouse . Visitors to Dornoch, pictured, have to move quickly if they wish to visit the abattoir - as its being demolished . The bizarre sign caused an online stir after it was posted on Twitter and retweeted by Scots crime writer Ian Rankin. The photo was originally put online by Jon Palmer from The Cheese House, Cromarty, who tweeted: ‘Market day tomorrow in the town that has all bases covered when it comes to tourist attractions.’ The tweet then quickly drew a series of facetious online comments. Stephen Foster asked: ‘Sweeney Todd lives anywhere nearby?’ Malcolm Ramsay said: ‘A trip to Dornoch? It’s kill or cure...’ Gavin Sutherland of Gavin’s Traditional Butchers, based in the nearby retail park in Dornoch, said yesterday of the abattoir: ‘It has been knocked to the ground. They are demolishing it as we speak. It’s been derelict for four or five years.’ Brown signs normally only point to attractions or sites of historic significance. A Highland Council spokesman said: ‘We are looking into the current status and accuracy of the sign in question.’"
"An artist with a surreal take on the natural world uses Photoshop to create whimsical, mind-bending pictures that would give Salvador Dali a run for his money. Anil Saxena, from Mumbai, uses ingenious retouching to create pictures of anything from a woman hanging a zebra's stripes on the line to dry to a pair of hands knitting a green field. He prides himself on his digital manipulation techniques, saying: 'If the image is a success but my work goes unnoticed, I'm doing my job well.' A woman in a colourful sari hangs up a zebra's stripes on a washing line . The photographer who has a background in graphic design and CGI, initially retouched his pictures by hand. Once he  started digital retouching he was able to turn his pictures into more complex flights of fancy. According to his biography on Design Taxi, the artist,  says the real work begins when 'lesser mortals might think that the image is just perfect.' The art website Behance says: 'Anil enjoys developing stunning imagery. He believes colour grading is paramount.' A painter colours  a giraffe as he leans a ladder against the animal . A sink is utilised as a swimming pool by a group of tiny people . Anil's photo manipulations blend the everyday with the bizarre, such as a man in a boiler suit climbing a ladder to paint a giraffe's distinctive coat pattern. In another a crystal swimming pool in which beautiful people lounge in bikinis or take a dip, is realised as a sink and instead of a giant diving board, they're all underneath a huge chrome tap.

"Tesco is close to ditching the last of the private jets used by its top executives after an accounting scandal that sparked the biggest crisis in its 95-year history. Britain’s biggest grocer operated a multimillion-pound fleet of five aircraft for its bosses, but after a disastrous year new chief executive Dave Lewis admitted the planes gave the wrong image and put them up for sale. Four have been sold and the final one, a Hawker 800, will be gone by the end of next month. A similar plane can cost up to £67,000 to charter. Tesco's old Gulfstream 550, worth around £30 million,  that was capable of flying 14 executives at a time . Just days ago, Tesco managed to sell its seven-year-old, Gulfstream 550, worth around £30million new. It was capable of flying 14 executives at a time. With a top speed of 580mph, powered by two Rolls-Royce engines, it was the height of luxury, kitted out with DVD players, widescreen TVs and a bar . It even had cabins allowing executives to sleep in full-sized beds on longer journeys to America and Asia. Mr Lewis hopes the sale of the fleet will draw a line under a difficult year in which Tesco lurched from crisis to crisis, including a fraud investigation into after a £263million black hole emerged in its accounts. The supermarket haemorrhaged senior staff losing its chairman, chief executive and finance director while being hit hard by competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen customers. In September Lewis was parachuted in from consumer goods giant Unilever. However less than four weeks after informing the City he no longer wanted to maintain the fleet, Lewis could not resist hopping onto a private jet to visit seven locations in Asia in four days. A spokesman said: ‘In October we said we would dispose of the five aircraft we operated. The last aircraft will be handed back by the end of May at the latest. Tesco spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world between 2005 and 2012 . ‘The aircraft have not been used by Tesco since December. In future we will use chartered aircraft only if there is a compelling business justification and travel cannot be completed by scheduled airline.’ Between 2005 and 2012 the firm has spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world. Previous chief executive Sir Terry Leahy has been reported as saying he preferred flights with EasyJet than flying on private jets but still managed to spend £2.3 million on the planes in 2009. The bill increased dramatically under the management of former boss Phil Clarke. In February 2011 under the tenure of Clarke it had jumped to £8.9 million. A brand new Gulfstream was delivered and sold almost immediately in November along with a Cessna Citation and another Hawker."
"Chris Christie's wife has quit her big-money job on Wall Street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016. May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video . Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co . According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire . Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him . She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state."
"Amazing pictures have emerged of  blue fluorescent algae lighting up Australia's east coast. The images were taken in Jervis Bay, the south coast of NSW, as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia's popular beaches. Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light. A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014 where an oceanography expert told Daily Mail Australia there was no need to be concerned about the algae. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Iain Suthers, of University of New South Wales, said. Mr Suthers explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. Scroll down for video .

Former NSA chief General Keith Alexander has warned that the U.S. and her allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault, with energy infrastructure likely to be hacker's prime target . Alexander, who led the U.S. battle against cyber-threats for much of the last decade, was speaking at a private dinner held by IHS CERAWeek in Texas last week, reports the Daily Telegraph. He envisioned a worst case-scenario where hackers targeted oil refineries, power stations, and the electric grid. The payments nexus of the major banks could also be paralysed he warned. 'We need something like an integrated air-defence system for the whole energy sector,' he said. Alexander listed five countries able to conduct cyber-warfare at the highest level: the US, UK, Israel, Russia and Iran. The current NSA chief Michael Rogers testified late last year that China is capable of cyber-attacks that could cause 'catastrophic failures' of the water system or the electricity grid. There is no suggestion that China has an intention to use its power to damage US infrastructure. NSA officials are less confident that Iran will show self-restraint. Alexander also voice his concern about the hacking threat from a terrorist organization such as ISIS. He said that the U.S. and her allies had failed to check the advance of ISIS and its expanding network of franchises across the Middle East."
"Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United at Elland Road after the Welsh club backed their fans in handing back their allocation of 500 tickets. Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United . The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game . Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets . The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets . 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were . Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon . West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday . Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The ""bad old days"" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of ""fans"" have thankfully been left far behind us now. This is now reflected in the respectful treatment received from the majority of clubs we visit. Let’s hope that this message hits home loud and clear to Leeds United Football Club.'"
"$2 million worth of stolen artwork has been found in a caretakers garage after disappearing from the walls of an inner-city Sydney penthouse. Three years after the theft, police were investigating a car syndicate and executed a search warrant on a Wiley Park property. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, in a discovery described as 'quite remarkable' by police, all of the paintings along with three stolen luxury cars were found. $2 million worth of stolen artwork has been found in a caretakers garage after disappearing from Sydney home . The works were stolen in 2010 after being taken from property investor, Peter O'Mara's home in Darling Point . 18 paintings were taken from property investor, Peter O'Mara's Darling Point home along with a bronze statue and silver bowl. The items were stolen between July 17 and August 10, 2010. Mr O'Mara was paid $1,033,473 by his insurance company, Chubb Insurance after the theft. Last week's NSW Supreme Court judgment revealed the Wiley Park address was 'the residential home of the parents of a caretaker of Mr O'Mara's residence'. At the time of the theft, Mr O'Mara said, 'It's a gut feeling, but the whole thing had to be set up.' The discovery found works like Victoria and Moonlight by Charles Blackman . Capricorn Haze by Tim Storrier was also found during the raid and now belongs to Chubb Insurance . After being seized, the artworks were delivered to the Art Gallery of New South Wales and have been ruled to Chubb Insurance for possession.

Stutzman, owner of Arlene's Flowers and Gifts in Richland, Washington, received the fine in Benton County Superior Court in March after refusing to serve same-sex couple Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed in 2013. When longtime customer Ingersoll came to Arlene's Flowers and asked for the flowers, the devout Southern Baptist told him her 'relationship with Jesus Christ' wouldn't allow her to do the wedding. After they were refused flowers, Ingersoll and Freed went ahead with a smaller wedding than they had planned. They got married in their home with 11 guests and flowers from another florist. In a February ruling, Benton County Superior Judge Alexander Ekstrom found that Stutzman's refusal to provide flowers because of sexual orientation violated Washington's anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws. Along with the fine, the judge's ruling also requires that everything Arlene's Flowers sells to opposite-sex couples has to be available at the same price to same-sex couples. Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office requested the fine, said in a statement Friday that the ruling is a reminder of the reach of Washington's anti-discrimination laws. 'My primary goal has always been to end illegal discrimination,' Ferguson said. 'I'm pleased that today's ruling clearly prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples.' Before Ferguson's office filed the consumer-protection lawsuit against Stutzman, it had sent her a letter asking for an agreement to no longer discriminate, which she refused. Ferguson's statement Friday said the office would not have sued if Stutzman had accepted the agreement . Breaking the law: In February,  a Benton County judge ruled that Stutzman's refusal to provide flowers for the ceremony was a violation of anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws.

"Pensioners aged over 75 will be guaranteed same-day appointments with their GP, as part of Tory plans for a huge cash injection for the NHS. David Cameron will announce the move today as he pledges to commit £8billion to fund the health service. This is the figure named by NHS boss Simon Stevens as the amount needed to help plug a £30billion hole in the health service’s accounts over the next five years. David Cameron will announce the move today as he pledges to commit £8billion to fund the health service . Prime Minister said last night he was ‘utterly committed’ to health service . The move is designed to demolish cynical Labour claims that the Tories would ‘cut the NHS to the bone’ and will mean ‘at least’ an extra £8billion a year for the NHS by 2020. The Prime Minister said last night he was ‘utterly committed’ to the health service. However, the promise that all over-75s will get a guaranteed same-day GP appointment will raise eyebrows among critics who say GPs are already struggling to cope. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last year announced a plan to ‘train and retain’ an extra 5,000 GPs, which Tory sources said last night would allow them to deliver the same-day pledge. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the move as a ‘good start’, but warned that, on current trends, an extra 8,000 GPs would be needed by 2020 just to stand still. Mr Hunt said: ‘The NHS has set out its vision for how we best improve the health service for patients, and today we are backing that plan with the money it needs. But we can only have a strong NHS if we have a strong economy. ‘We need to do much more to ensure our vulnerable elderly can be treated in the community. That is why we are building on our decision to bring back named GPs for the over-75s by ensuring that, as part of this, they are guaranteed a same-day GP service when they need it. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last year announced a plan to ‘train and retain’ an extra 5,000 GPs . ‘This means family doctors can focus on giving elderly people the care they need, and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital.’ The guarantee will build on the new ‘proactive care programme’, which requires GPs to offer a priority service to their most vulnerable 2 per cent of patients. The decision to back the ‘Stevens plan’ is designed to neutralise Labour attacks on the issue. Mr Cameron said the commitment to find the money would be included in next week’s Conservative Party manifesto. Referring to the care given to his late son Ivan, the Prime Minister said: ‘As someone who has been supported by the NHS at the most difficult time in my life, I’m utterly committed to ensuring it is there for everyone when they need it too. ‘That’s why I’m backing the NHS’s own plan with the cash required to ensure it can continue to deliver an amazing service to patients and their families in the future.’ The Tory move will pile pressure on Labour to put its money where its mouth is on the NHS. This week, Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said he could not commit to Mr Stevens’s five-year plan, adding: ‘I’m not in the business of making false promises or giving cheques to the NHS that will bounce a few days after the election.’ Tory sources last night insisted the money could be found through efficiency savings and the proceeds of economic growth. They pointed to official figures showing that NHS spending has increased by £7billion in real terms since 2010, despite the austerity programme. A source said: ‘We have delivered a £7billion increase even when the economy was really struggling from Labour’s recession in the first few years. Now we have got years of economic growth forecast, so it is do-able and we will do it.’"
"A chameleon balances carefully on a branch, waiting calmly for its prey... except that if you look closely, you will see that this picture is not all that it seems. For the 'creature' poised to pounce is not a colourful species of lizard but something altogether more human. Featuring two carefully painted female models, it is a clever piece of sculpture designed to create an amazing illusion. It is the work of Italian artist Johannes Stoetter. Scroll down for video . Can you see us? Italian artist Johannes Stoetter has painted two naked women to look like a chameleon . The 37-year-old has previously transformed his models into frogs and parrots but this may be his most intricate and impressive piece to date. Stoetter daubed water-based body paint on the naked models to create the multicoloured effect, then intertwined them to form the shape of a chameleon. To complete the deception, the models rested on a bench painted to match their skin and held the green branch in the air beneath them. Stoetter can take weeks to plan one of his pieces and hours to paint it. Speaking about The Chameleon, he said: 'I worked about four days to design the motif bigger and paint it with colours. 'The body painting took me about six hours with the help of an assistant. 'I covered the hair with natural clay to make the heads look bald. Camouflage job: A few finishing touches are applied to the two naked models to complete the transformation . 'There are different difficulties on different levels as in every work, but I think that my passion and love to my work is so big, that I figure out a way to deal with difficulties. 'My main inspirations are nature, my personal life-philosophy, every-day-life and people themselves. However, the finished result existed only briefly before the models were able to get up and wash the paint off – with just a video and some photographs to record it. The artist added:   'I think that body painting is a good way to learn to let something go, to separate from something. That happens again and again in life and it is good to be able to handle with it. 'Also the fast end of the artwork makes us perceive it in a much more intensive way.' But there is one way in which the chameleon can still claim to be the unchallenged master of disguise. Unlike the real thing, Stoetter's models can't change their colour – unless he gets his paintbrush out."
"Tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, according to a study of infants’ brains which overturns the medical consensus. Until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain. It means that newborns often go without painkillers, even during invasive procedures. But the new findings, revealed by Oxford University doctors, suggest that not only do babies feel pain, but their pain thresholds are even lower than those of adults. Scroll down for video . Research on infants’ brains by doctors from Oxford University has found that young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults. It overturns the medical consensus that newborns have a high pain threshold (file picture) In the first study of its kind, the researchers showed in brain scans that infants’ brains react in much the same way as adults when given even mild pain. Dr Rebeccah  Slater, of Oxford’s department of Paediatrics, said: ‘Obviously babies can’t tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations. ‘In fact some people have argued that babies’ brains are not developed enough for them to really “feel” pain, any reaction being just a reflex – our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case.’ The results, published in the journal eLife, suggest that it is possible to see pain ‘happening’ inside the infant brain - and it looks a lot like pain in adults. Up until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery - they were given neuromuscular blocks to stop them moving, but otherwise were given no pain medication. A landmark study in 1987 suggested for the first time that doctors may have been wrong in their assumptions, and anaesthetics were introduced for major operations. But injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief, and far more serious procedures carried out anything to take away the child’s pain. Even this year, NHS guidelines are still being written that advise doctors to carry out seemingly painful procedures without anything more than ‘a cuddle’. Guidelines for a procedure to treat tongue-tie - a common problem in which the bottom of an infant’s tongue is attached to the mouth - still suggest that no pain relief is needed. The research, which was carried out by doctors from Oxford University (pictured) overturns the medical consensus that very young babies do not feel pain and do not need painkillers, even for invasive procedures . The NHS guidelines, updated in January 2015, advise that when the tongue is sliced from the mouth’s floor, infants do not need medication. Older babies who have already teethed should be given a general anaesthetic, doctors are told. But the guidelines say: ‘In small babies, being cuddled and fed is more important than painkillers.’ Dr Slater called for a review of the way tiny babies are treated. ‘Thousands of babies across the UK undergo painful procedures every day but there are often no local pain management guidelines to help clinicians,’ she said. ‘Our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults. ‘We have to think that if we would provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a procedure then we should look at giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure.’ Her team scanned the brains of ten healthy infants aged between one and six days old, and compared them to the brains of ten adults aged 23 to 36 years. MRI scans were taken of the babies’ brains as they were poked on the bottom of their feet with a special retracting rod creating a sensation like being poked with a pencil – mild enough that it did not wake them up. The researchers found that 18 of the 20 pain regions in adults’ brains also ‘lit up’ in babies’ brains. Scans also showed that babies’ brains had the same response to a weak poke as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong - suggesting their pain thresholds are lower. Dr Slater said it is not clear which types of painkiller would be best used for babies. There are fears that local anaesthetics can be easily absorbed into the blood stream, with unknown consequences. ‘Finding the optimum pain relief for babies is clearly required,’ she said."
"A plane seat specifically targeted at making plane travel more comfortable for obese passengers and small children has won a prize for its innovation vision this week. The adapted chair by SII Deutschland, beat off competition from 21 finalists to win the Passenger Comfort Hardware award at The Crystal Cabin Awards in Hamburg, Germany. Sitting at one-and-a-half times the width of a standard seat, the SANTO seat (Special Accommodation Needs for Toddlers and Overweight Passengers) aims to improve aircrew procedure and passenger safety. Passenger Comfort Hardware winner: The SANTO seat by SII Deutschland is larger than usual seats, and makes use of space at the back of aircraft where the fuselage narrows . The adapted seat would make use of the usually wasted space at the back of aircraft, where the fuselage narrows. It would be a larger version of the aircraft chairs, meaning a wider passenger could comfortably and safety fit in the chair, without disrupting the neighbouring customer. As the SANTO seat has an extra half a seat width, a baby seat could be fitted securely into the chair, with enough space for a regular customer to sit alongside without paying for an extra seat. The designs were judged by a team of 24 experts, including panel chairwoman Melissa Raudebaugh, General Manager of Aircraft Experience at Delta Air Lines. 'Selecting the Crystal Cabin Award winners was a tough decision this year, as all finalists were of very high quality - ranging from renowned manufacturers to inspiring university concepts, which we will hopefully see flying soon', said Raudebaugh, as reported by PR Newswire. The seat won the prize as part of the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, and addresses the issue of the safety for obese passengers . Not only being space effective, the larger chair aims to address the on-going debate about whether  to charge obese passengers for two seats. Some American airlines have adopted this principle if customers are unable to buckle their seatbelt without the use of a seatbelt extender. In 2011 a male passenger claims he was forced to stand for seven hours in the aisle of a plane on his US Airways flight, from Anchorage to Philadelphia, as a 400lb man took up a lot of his seat. Another solution was put forward by Samoa Air in 2013 charging customers depending on their weight, in a bid to reduce fuel costs. Visitors look at Expliseat wide seats weighing four kilos at  the Aircraft Interiors Expo 2014. It is the leading trade fair for aircraft cabin designers and presents novelties in design, entertainment and connectivity . The Crystal Cabin Awards were awarded as part of Aircraft Interiors Expo which aims to showcase world's most advanced and creative ideas for the aircraft cabin. The SANTO was not the only seat design aiming to solve the issue of comfort when it comes to overweight passengers. Expliseat also displayed wider seating designs to accommodate larger passnegers. Prestigious aviation companies such as B/E Aerospace and Etihad Airways showed their concepts at the international trade fair of aircraft interiors which took place from April 14 to 16. Other awarded ideas included B/E Aerospace's solar cell films on cabin windows, and a vacuum technology to reduce space of waste by lavatories and trash bags created by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. Premium Class & VIP: A380 Upper Deck by Etihad (UAE) One highlight this year was in the head-to-head A380-First Class race between two airlines from the United Arab Emirates. Etihad Airways won by a nose with its 'A380 Upper Deck'. Etihad is the first airline in the world to install a three room apartment in a commercial airliner, the 'Residence by Etihad'. Behind the Residence is the First Class Cabin with nine compartments and 70 Business Class seats. Greener Cabin, Health, Safety & Environment: Solar Eclipse by B/E Aerospace (USA) A thin solar cell film is installed in the sun visor of the cabin window, providing passengers with electricity to charge their electronic devices during flight. Although the system is still under development, the manufacturer is already working on achieving production approval soon. Industrial Design & Visionary Concepts: E2 Cabin Concept by Embraer (Brazil) The cabin for Embraers E2 generation of regional jets, is characterised by an innovative, easy maintenance design. The use of space is especially well thought-out. Special baggage lockers, for example, and a staggered seating concept, provide more space in the aircraft. Passenger Comfort Hardware: SANTO Seat by SII Deutschland (Germany) The 'SANTO Seat' (Special Accommodation Needs for Toddlers and Overweight Passengers) is beneficial for both passengers and airlines. The normally wasted space at the rear of the aircraft cabin, where the fuselage narrows, is used by a special seat, one-and-a-half times the width of a normal seat. The seat is ideal for overweight passengers and for passengers with small children. For these passengers, the seat is safer than a standard seat. Passenger Comfort Systems: Exede in the Air by ViaSat (USA) The satellite-powered 'Exede in the Air' solution brings a 12 Mbps internet connection to every seat, allowing passengers to stream films or shop online above the clouds without difficulty. Material & Components: LEXAN XHR2000 by SABIC Innovative Plastics (UAE) The 'LEXAN XHR2000' film has a transparency level of 80 percent, currently the highest possible level. Application possibilities range from windows to surface elements within the cabin, providing interior designers in particular with completely new possibilities. University: Trash Compactor by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (Germany) Marc Spille a student of aviation studies, in collaboration with Airbus, developed a mobile trash container which uses the vacuum technology of the on-board lavatory to compress trash bags into a space-saving format within seconds."

"Inter Milan target Yaya Toure has admitted that he is open to 'new challenges' and will not remain at Manchester City just to pick up his £220,000-a-week wages. The Premier League champions want to reshape their squad this summer after a disappointing season and they could look to offload the 31-year-old, who has struggled to hit top form. Toure, who is wanted by his former manager Roberto Mancini, appears open to a move away from the Etihad if the right opportunity presents itself at the end of the season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer . Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine's goal against West Ham . Speaking to Foot Mercato, he said: 'No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me. 'It would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don't stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. 'For the future, I don't know more than you do, because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature. 'When I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight until the end of my career at this club. 'My decisions will not be affected by changes in management, but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.' City find themselves fourth in the Premier League table after a dismal run of form and out of the Champions League after a two-legged defeat by Barcelona at the last 16 stage. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City . Toure's form has been disappointing this season and City are likely to try and sell him this summer . Whether Manuel Pellegrini remains manager or is sacked this summer will not affect Toure's decision . Some of Toure's performances have been heavily criticised but the Ivorian remains defiant. 'When things are not necessarily going well in a club, the key players take the fall,' he added. 'I am not the only one to have been attacked even if there is tendency to be harsher with me. Football is my passion, my job and that gives me two good reasons to do as well as I can.'"
"Cad: Poet Rupert Brooke had a string of short-lived relationships with various women before he died aged 27 in April 1915 . Poet Rupert Brooke has long had a reputation as a 'young Apollo', a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the senseless slaughter of the First World War. But a new haul of previously unseen letters show that he was in fact a slightly caddish womaniser who had a string of affairs without ever settling down. The documents, brought to light for the first time thanks to a £430,000 grant, show Brooke's lovers complaining about his refusal to take their relationships seriously. The letters are part of the John Schroder collection, which has spent decades in private hands but will now be available to the public after being bought by King's College, Cambridge, where the poet was a student. Brooke, who died 100 years ago today at the age of just 27, became a semi-legendary figure thanks to his early death and his popular poems such as The Soldier. His obituary was written by Winston Churchill, who called him 'all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be'. However, the letters in the Schroder collection - including 170 documents written by Brooke himself - show a somewhat different side to the great poet. King's archivist Patricia McGuire said that Brooke was 'promiscuous even for a man of his time' and carried on relationships with multiple girlfriends. 'Several women thought he was going to marry them - he may have thought that he was going to,' Dr McGuire told The Times. 'I think he was happy to spend a lot of time with as many women as he could.' Among the lovers whose affairs with Brooke are featured in the letters are Hollywood star Cathleen Nesbitt, artist Phyllis Gardner, and Laurence Olivier's cousin Noël. Lovers: Cathleen Nesbitt, left, and Phyllis Gardner, right, are among the women who had affairs with Brooke . Popular: Brooke became one of Britain's best-loved poets after his premature death . Nesbitt wrote to Eddie Marsh, Brooke's biographer, saying: 'I've no intention of marrying anybody for years to come - nor, I hope, has Rupert - though I shouldn't be in the least surprised if he settled in the wild with a squaw and a wigwam.' In another letter, she described the poet's care-free attitude in the face of the danger he submitted himself to in the war. Nesbitt wrote: 'When I talked of all things coming to an end he would always laugh and say, ""Hush - there's never any end when things are perfect.""' This is not the first time that Brooke's reputation has taken a battering - previously discovered letters have shown him expressing unpalatable views on Jews and homosexuals. And this year a book about his affair with Phyllis Gardner revealed that he opposed the women's rights movements and privately said that 'all women are beasts'. The pair bathed naked together near Grantchester, the village outside Cambridge where Brooke lived in the Old Vicarage, now home to Jeffrey Archer. Trove: Peter Jones of King's College, Cambridge with a haul of letters which the college has now bought thanks to a £430,000 grant . Home: The Old Vicarage in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, where Brooke once lived . If I should die, think only this of me: . That there's some corner of a foreign field . That is forever England. There shall be . In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; . A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, . Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, . A body of England's, breathing English air, . Washed by the rivers, blest by the suns of home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, . A pulse in the eternal mind, no less . Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; . Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; . And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, . In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. Despite the recent revelations, Brooke has retained his image as a 'young Apollo' cut down in his prime, whose poems encapsulate typically English scenes. His poem The Soldier, featuring the line 'there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England', was immensely popular during the First World War, and made even more poignant when Brooke himself died while on active service on April 23, 1915. Churchill wrote in his obituary, published in The Times: 'He was all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be in the days when no sacrifice but the most precious is acceptable, and the most precious is that which is most freely proffered.' Peter Jones, the librarian at King's, said: 'It is hard to realise today just how significant Brooke's impact was 100 years ago. 'In the early 20th century as a poet you were fortunate to sell 200-300 copies of your work. Just after his death, Brooke's close friend and patron Eddie Marsh published 1914 and Other Poems. 'The first edition of 1,000 sold out immediately and, in all, 160,000 copies were sold of various impressions.' He added: 'We now know much more about Brooke as a person and he is certainly more interesting and, in some ways more difficult, than the heroic image portrayed at the time of his death. 'He was a conflicted individual. He had a major breakdown in 1912 and had disastrous relationships with the women who loved him.' One of the letters now made available reveals how Brooke's mother Mary Ruth sought to avoid turning her son into an icon, and also intervened to stop Marsh inserting details of his more sordid relationships. Lorna Beckett, chairman of the Rupert Brooke Society, said: 'He was an interesting, complex and likeable person who is still suffering from the hostile backlash brought about by the ""young Apollo"" myth created straight after his death.'"
"A cocky teenager wanted for alleged fraud and theft taunted police on their Facebook page for failing to catch him - and got arrested hours later. 18-year-old Ryan Heritage from Wiltshire posted a obnoxious message on Trowbridge police's page, saying: 'Oi yo check if there's a warrant for my arrest, if so good luck!!!' He went out for a night out in his home town where he was spotted by police who chased him on foot before finally grabbing him. The Trowbridge Neighbourhood Policing Team then re-posted his original message and added their own: 'His luck ran out #arrested.' Arrogant: 18-year-old Ryan Heritage posted a cocky message on his local police's Facebook page where he taunted them for failing to catch him . Jokes on you: He was arrested in Trowbridge, Wiltshire just hours after posting the message which read 'Oi yo check if there's a warrant for my arrest, if so good luck' Heritage was thrown in the cells for the night and put before magistrates the following morning where he was charged with theft and burglary - and failing to answer bail on fraud charges. The police posted on Facebook: 'A local male wanted on suspicion of theft, and also wanted on warrant for failing to appear in court has been spotted in town. Following a short foot chase he has been arrested. 'Ryan has been charged with theft, and is going to court in connection with the warrant issued for failing to appear in respect of fraud charges.' Wiltshire police then said: 'There was a warrant out for his arrest because he had failed to appear in court and obviously he thought he was going to be able to escape us so he posted that message. 'When he was arrested in Trowbridge he was found to be in possession of a small amount of cannabis. He was given a caution for that and charged with a number of other offences.' Magistrates bailed Heritage to report to Melksham police on June 4 - and before Justice of the Peace Court in Swindon on May 20 on another theft charge. Caught: Heritage was thrown in the cells for the night and put before magistrates the following morning where he was charged with theft and burglary .

"UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones ran from a crash that hospitalised a pregnant woman - but quickly came back to grab 'a large handful of cash' from the car, witnesses told police. According to police, the accident occurred in southeastern Albuquerque just before noon on Sunday local time when the driver of a rented SUV jumped a red light. The driver, whom an off-duty officer identified as Jones, ran from the scene but then returned for the cash before fleeing again, police said. 'Witnesses stated he shoved the cash into his pants and ran north jumping the fence,' the report said. Officers found a pipe with marijuana in the vehicle as well as MMA and rental car documents in Jones' name, according to the police report. Police were searching for UFC  champion Jon Jones in connection with a hit-and-run accident . Albuquerque police were seeking an arrest warrant for Jones on Monday. They said he would likely face a felony charge of leaving the scene of an accident since the woman broke her arm in the crash. Police said in a news release they'd been unable to reach Jones or his lawyer. However, Jones handed himself in later the same day, with TMZ reporting he was being held at Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center. According to the warrant, the pregnant woman told police she was driving when she was hit by a silver Buick SUV. According to the document, she told authorities after the accident  'I am pregnant and I feel like I am going to pass out. My arm is hurting all the way up and my husband is going to take me to the hospital.' The woman's arm is in a sling and she will get a cast on Tuesday, the warrant said. According to the warrant, she was planning to undergo a Monday ultrasound. The warrant also said the off-duty officer  told responding police he could confirm Jones' identity because 'I watch UFC all the time, I know what Jon Jones looks like.' An agent for Jones, Malki Kawa, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment from Daily Mail Online on Monday. Kawa also did not immediately respond to a message from Associated Press. Jones (21-1) is scheduled to defend his title against Anthony 'Rumble'Johnson at UFC 187 in Las Vegas on May 23, headlining one of the promotion's biggest shows of the year. Police were seeking an arrest warrant for Jones on Monday, saying he would likely face a felony charge . Jones has endured legal problems and questionable behaviour during his time as a UFC champion . 'We are aware that the Albuquerque Police Department is interested in speaking to Jon Jones regarding his possible involvement in a motor vehicle accident,' the UFC said in a Sunday statement. The message continued: 'We are in the process of gathering facts and will reserve further comment until more information is available.' Although he is widely considered the world's best pound-for-pound mixed martial artist, Jones has endured legal problems and questionable behaviour as champion.

"(CNN)James Best, best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on TV's ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88. Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague. Although he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when ""The Dukes of Hazzard's"" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night. For seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his ""hot pursuit"" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car. Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive ""kew-kew-kew"" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as ""cuff 'em and stuff 'em!"" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best's ""Hazzard"" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. ""I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,"" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. ""Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend."" ""Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,"" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. ""Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions."" Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""Bonanza,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Gunsmoke."" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including ""Hooper"" and ""The End."" But Best will always be best known for his ""Hazzard"" role, which lives on in reruns. ""Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,"" Latshaw said. ""I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier."" People we've lost in 2015 . CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this story."
"An Australian businesswoman has come out on top against the world's 13th richest billionaire after stopping BeneFit Cosmetics from using the term 'Brow Bar' exclusively. Beautician Chernae Noonan, who founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar, has blocked the cosmetic giant's application to trademark the phrase. BeneFit is owned by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), which is run by luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault. Australian beautician Chernae Noonan founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar in 2003 . Mr Arnault's estimate wealth is thought to be $37.4 billion and makes him the second richest person in France, according to Forbes. The case between Ms Noonan and BeneFit was heard in the Australian Trade Marks Office earlier this year in February and ruled in the Queensland woman's favour. Ms Noonan started her business in 2003 in her Springwood home and since then it has seen 'significant growth'. She has rolled out six stores across Australia - including on the Gold Coast, Sydney and Melbourne. She has stopped BeneFit Cosmetics from using 'Brow Bar' exclusively after the company launched an application to trademark the term in Australia . The Brow Bar services 'women of relatively high disposable income aged 25 to 55' along with a small group of men. Ms Noonan took action against BeneFit when the cosmetics giant sought to trademark 'Brow Bar' in Australia in 2011. BeneFit is owned by luxury goods company LVMH, which is run by the world's 13th richest billionaire, Bernard Arnault (pictured) She said customers would confuse her business, The Brow Bar, with BeneFit Brow Bar at Myer stores in Western Australia, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. According to the ruling, Ms Noonan said journalists, media writers and online forum contributors often confused the two. Lawyers for BeneFit told the Australian Trade Marks Office the company had already trademarked the term in Hong Kong and Mexico, and had been using the name in its United States stores since 2003. Hearing officer Nicole Worth said she did not consider the word 'Brow Bar' to be used commonly enough to be deemed as 'generic' as lawyers for BeneFit argued. She added the addition of the word 'BeneFit' to 'Brow Bar' also did not help differentiate the cosmetic giant's services from Ms Noonan's business. 'Additionally, although [BeneFit] did not know of [Ms Noonan's] trademark when it adopted the phrase ""browbar"" in the USA, it is reasonable to expect that it ought to have checked the Australian market for conflicting trade marks before entering it,' Ms Worth said. 'It also continued to expand its business under the [trademark] in the knowledge that a prior conflicting mark was registered and being used... That it did so is a risk it chose to bear.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Noonan for further comment but she did not wish to as BeneFit is appealing the decision. A statement on the matter has also been sought from the cosmetics brand."

"Ralph Vaughan Williams's Lark Ascending is the nation's favourite piece of classic music . The Lark Ascending has been voted the nation's favourite piece of classical music. Ralph Vaughan Williams's work topped the Classic FM Hall of Fame after listeners cast more than 200,000 votes. It topped the poll last year as well and four years ago was named the nation's favourite Desert Island Discs tune. British composer Vaughan Williams was inspired by a poem of the same name by George Meredith. He completed the more familiar orchestral version in 1920. It found a wide audience last year when it was played as Hayley, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, took a lethal cocktail to end her suffering on Coronation Street, following a battle with cancer. The top five was completed by Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2, another Vaughan Williams work Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, Elgar's Enigma Variations and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5. The full poll - 300 pieces of music in total - also includes 12 pieces of music used to soundtrack video games, with two of them making the top 20. Music from the Final Fantasy series, by Japanese composer Nobuo Uematsu, is at number nine while The Elder Scrolls, composed by Bafta award-winner Jeremy Soule, is at number 11. John Suchet, who presents a weekday show on the station, said: 'Twenty years after the very first Classic FM Hall of Fame countdown, I'm delighted that we've attracted so many votes for our chart. 'What I find truly exciting is the continued increase in a younger audience for classical music - I didn't expect to be thanking the video game industry for introducing the genre to a new generation of people, but it's wonderful.'

"A nurse who faced surgery to treat breast cancer at the hospital where she worked discovered just days later that she'd never had the disease. A mix-up at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton meant staff confused the notes of three patients. As a result, Elizabeth Dawes was wrongly told in July 2013 that she had invasive grade three breast cancer following a biopsy. Doctors advised the 39-year-old that she needed immediate surgery, suggesting a double mastectomy. Ms Dawes refused, but did undergo major surgery to remove a 'cancerous' tumour from her right breast as well as lymph nodes from her armpit. Elizabeth Dawes, 39, was told she had breast cancer in July 2013. Doctors at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton told her she needed immediate surgery and chemotherapy. But four days after the operation she was told staff had confused her medical notes with those of other patients, and she'd never had cancer . The mother-of-one was also told she would need a further procedure to correct 'deformities' to her breasts caused by the first operation. But four days later, Ms Dawes was asked to attend an appointment with her consultant. There, he revealed there had been a mix-up with her hospital notes and those of two other patients, - and she had, in fact, never had the disease. She said: 'I am absolutely appalled at what I have been through and am still struggling to comprehend how this could even happen. 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order.' 'I was willing to undergo whatever treatment it took to fight the cancer so when I was told I needed surgery, I didn't think twice.' Ms Dawes was so traumatised she needed anti-depressants and was forced to give up her job in the oncology department at New Cross Hospital. , added: 'The doctor also told me I would need a bilateral breast lift to cosmetically improve the shape of my breasts, as otherwise, after having the cancer surgery I would be left deformed. 'I was very sore after the operation and shocked by the extensive scaring, so to be recalled four days later to be told none of it was necessary was truly horrendous. 'I am still in pain now, have lost a lot of sensation in my breasts and the scarring has not improved, which hugely affects my self-confidence. 'Nothing can make up for what has happened but I am determined to see justice done and feel I at least deserve an official apology from the Trust given the huge impact this has had on my life.' Ms Dawes, who has an 18-year-old son, is taking legal action. The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which operates the hospital, has admitted liability for the misdiagnosis and the unnecessary surgery performed. The mother-of-one, who was working as a breast cancer care nurse at the same hospital at the time, said: 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order' Lawyer Louise Hawkley, of Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This is a truly shocking case that has left Elizabeth appalled at the unnecessary heartache, and extensive scarring she has suffered as a result of being wrongly told that she had breast cancer. 'There are also very serious patient safety concerns about the ""mix-up"" and how the other patients have potentially been affected too.' She said aside from the 'obvious physical implications', the ordeal has had 'a devastating impact' on her client's life. Ms Dawes had worked as a breast care nurse in the Oncology Department at New Cross Hospital but has since found herself unable to continue in her role 'as a consequence of what she has been through'. Ms Hawkley added: 'It is also vital that the Trust identifies what improvements can be made to ensure that this never happens again to improve patient safety at the hospital.' A trust spokesman told MailOnline it has apologised to Ms Dawes and carried out a full investigation. He said: 'The medical director and nurse director met with Ms Dawes to offer her an unreserved apology for this terrible error and inform her of the trust’s investigation into the incident. 'The findings of the investigation were shared with Ms Dawes and a further apology offered at that time. 'The incident is now part of an ongoing legal claim with which the trust is co-operating fully. 'The trust can confirm that no other patient received inappropriate treatment as a result of this incident.' The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which operates the hospital, has admitted liability and a spokesman said an apology had been issued to Ms Dawes. He added no other patient received inappropriate treatment ."
"It is perhaps the most iconic ship of all time, but the closest most people will get to the Titanic is a visit to the museum in Belfast, or a viewing of the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet blockbuster. Not so for those with endless funds. One company is offering the chance to dive 12,500ft below the surface of the sea to explore the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic. The tour takes in sights like the famous grand staircase, the ship's huge anchors and the Marconi Room, from which the world's very first SOS was broadcast. The once-in-a-lifetime privilege is being offered by luxury concierge service, Bluefish, and does not come cheap, setting you back a whopping £41,000 ($60,000). Unique experience: Travel to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the wreck of the Titanic with concierge service Bluefish . Haunting: Beams of light illuminate the features of the tragic ship, which sank on April 14, 1912 . A port side forward expansion joint on the boat deck of the bow section of the shipwreck. Travellers will learn about the ship in a series of lectures in addition to the dive . The hefty price may seem like a lot but more than 40 people have so far booked the trip to the Atlantic Ocean depths. Director of Bluefish, Steve Sims said: 'We have sent over 40 people down and they have been housewives to technology billionaires, the Titanic really does capture the minds of a wide crowd. 'Bluefish is known for providing the amazing and rare and the Titanic fits both those criteria. 'More people have been into space than set eyes on the Titanic.' Guests will stay aboard the Akademik Keldysh ship at sea and wait for suitable conditions to see the Titanic up close. The transport to the ocean floor is a MIR I or II submersible which are capable of reaching ocean depths of 20,000 ft (98 per cent of the ocean floor worldwide) and withstanding intense pressure. The submersible is constructed of nickel steel and can hold one pilot and two passengers, providing a personal encounter of the vessel. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship. As well as this divers can spot harrowing personal items such as shoes or bags caught between the metal rust, which serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic human loss. The starboard railing near the bow of the Titanic. Expeditions take place in a MIR I or II submersible, which is able to withstand the water pressure 12500ft below the surface . The wreck of the Titanic is situated around 676 kilometres from Newfoundland, almost four kilometres below the surface . Not only does the trip offer a truly unique ocean expedition, but it also offers the chance to learn about the majestic vessel in depth. You will take part in a series of lectures and briefings, revealing latest findings about the 269 metre-long liner. There will also be a ceremony commemorating the tragic events and remembering all those who lost their lives on April 14, 1912. Meals, accommodation and personal video are also included in the somewhat hefty price tag. The RV Keldysh and MIRs have made over 15 expeditions to the site of the wreck and have made over a hundred dives. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship . Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! More people have been to space than have explored the Titanic, and the dives aim to collect data for scientific experiments . The aim of the dives is not just tourism, but also obtaining imagery from the site, data and physical samples from the wreck to further research and be used in ongoing scientific experiments being conducted by worldwide scientists . Since Deep Ocean Expeditions began dives to the wreck in 1998 no artefacts have been removed from the site . However it hasn't been plain sailing for Bluefish trips to see the famous ship. Only eight people took the voyage between 2002 and 2006 and after the recession put a strain on luxury spending. 'The recession hit and everything went to pot,' Simms told CNN Money. After years of fruitless searching by many organisations the wreck of the RMS Titanic was found by Dr Robert Ballard in 1986. Since that time multiple dives have been conducted by some of the world’s five deep diving submersibles, representing France, USA and Russia . Now the service has picked back up and guests can experience the whole package, or opt to have everything apart from the dive to the wreck, for £6,820 ($10,000). The bespoke concierge service offers a range of elaborate services, besides the Titanic expedition. Whether it is racing half a million dollars Mercedes in the Mojave Desert, a Virgin Galactic flight into space, or having a James Bond experience in Monaco with Bond girls and being rescued by American Navy Seals, Simms sees no challenge as impossible for the right clients. The luxury does not come cheap, with membership to the club being £3,414 ($5,000) per annum before you have forked out for any experience. Star-crossed lovers! Many were captivated by the James Cameron film, released in 1997, which saw the affluent Rose (played by Kate Winslet) fall in love with poor Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) on the Titanic's fateful voyage ."
"A driver was shocked to receive a £50 fine for failing to display his tax disc - despite it not becoming a legal requirement six months ago.

The businessman is now refusing to pay the fine that was issued in a Torbay council car park. Scroll down for video . 'Diabolical': Phil Haste (left) said he could not understand why he was issued with a penalty notice, as he clearly had a valid parking permit in his car and no longer required his tax disc to be shown . Mr Haste sent his appeal to the council on Saturday after being issued with the ticket last month and said it was a 'diabolical' decision to fine him. The government abolished paper tax discs on October 1 last year, meaning they no longer need to be shown on a vehicle windscreen. Mr Haste, who lives in Torquay, said: 'I would rather go to court than pay the fine. Issuing tickets of this ilk show they haven't got a clue what they are talking about. 'It's diabolical. The council employ these people to do a job for them and it's clearly not being presented clearly. 'They are obviously trying to just grab money where they can. I don't understand why I got this fine.' 'Haven't got a clue': The 60-year-old was also told he had not shown a pay and display ticket in his car, even though he has a valid car parking permit on his dashboard (pictured) The 60-year-old, who owns the yacht brokers' Quayside Marine, added: 'I don't need a tax disc so I don't know why they issued this. 'I have a car parking permit which was clearly on display on the dashboard of my car, so I just can't understand it.' Torbay Council said it was not their policy to issue fines for road tax offences and urged Mr Haste to appeal. A spokesman said: 'We do not issue parking penalty charge notices with regard to road tax and Mr Haste will have been advised on how to appeal against this ticket as it is stated on the reverse of the penalty charge notice.'"

The 55-year-old newsman is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he looks to return to his post on NBC Nightly News, according to a source close to the network. It comes after it was revealed that an internal inquiry found Williams's had lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams (pictured) has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported . He was suspended in February with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. A source said to be close to NBC has told The New York Post how Williams 'is saying he’s not going down without a fight and (is) threatening to make it really ugly'. Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of the Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends. Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade . Yesterday it was reported that NBC News chief Andrew Lack wanted Williams to resume his role. But this contradicted earlier claims that NBC executives wanted Williams out and were trying to negotiate his resignation. A source told the New York Daily News 'Andy (Lack) believes viewers want him (Williams) back. 'The feeling is that (Williams') problem seems to be more with the media and other reporters than his viewers - if Andy can figure out a way to get him back on the air he will do it.' The source added that Lack 'will not make a decision about Williams' fate until the network's internal probe is complete.' On Tuesday, a report emerged in the Hollywood Reporter that Lack was in fact not convinced that Williams would be able to return. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims.

"Charlie Chaplin's divorce papers lay bare the film star's 'cruel and inhumane' treatment of his teenage bride during their short-lived marriage. Chaplin's union to Lita Grey, who was nearly 20 years his junior, lasted just three years. The iconic film star was said have bedded the impressionable 16-year-old after promising her marriage and then tried to convince her to have an abortion when she fell pregnant. On the pairs wedding night Chaplin was also said to have confided in friends that the union was a better prospect than prison. An original copy of the couples 50-page divorce papers was set to fetch an estimated £15,000 when it goes under the hammer, after being found in America. The 50-page divorce papers of Charlie Chaplin and his second wife Lita Grey were found in a bank in America . Charlie Chaplin, left, married second wife Lita Grey, right, who was nearly 20 years his jounior, in 1924 and the union lasted for just three years . The divorce papers are set to fetch an estimated £15,000 when they go under the hammer in Plymouth . Chaplin, then 35, married his second wife Lita, 16, in 1924. They divorced just three years later with the teenager lifting the lid on their marriage. In the papers it was alleged that Chaplin slept with the 'virtuous and inexperienced' Lita when she was barely 16 after promising to marry her. On their wedding night Chaplin was said to have told friends that the marriage was a better option than prison. He said to Lita: 'This marriage won't last long, I will make you so damn sick of me that you won't want to live with me.' Another part claims Chaplin delayed marrying Lita after she fell pregnant in an attempt to get her to have an abortion or 'criminal operation'. And the silent movie star was accused of calling his young bride a 'gold digger' who tried to ruin his career and stood in the way if his professional success. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings. Only around 16 copies of the divorce proceedings were believed to have been made, one sent to Chaplin himself and the others sent to various film companies and banks, involved in the proceedings. The papers for sale in Devon, were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927. Almost a century later they are being sold by Parade Antiques on Plymouth for £15,000. The papers for sale were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927 . Lita claimed that she endured 'cruel and inhumane' treatment by Chaplin in the legal papers . John Cabello, who owns the antiques shop, said: 'We got it from a person in America - he was told to clear out some supplies and old documents at the bank and he found them. 'He was told they would be thrown away and he kept them instead. 'When the papers were published, Chaplin was ostracised for a while. People in the know thought he was quite a nasty piece of work. 'All this comes out and makes for quite hard reading, even by today's standards.' Rob Morrish, 27, who runs the shop's website, poured over the historic legal documents. The 27-year-old said: 'About a week's worth of work went into researching the document, reading through it took some time. 'It's all hand signed and very old and fragile. It was folded for a long time and required a lot of very careful handling.' The papers reveal intimate details of the couples unstable relationship, believed to be an attempt by Lita's lawyers to tarnish Chaplin's reputation and gain a bigger settlement. Mr Morrish said: 'They met on set of one of his films and he seduced her as a young woman. It was frowned upon but he tried to make the most of the situation. 'When she became pregnant he wasn't particularly pleased to be trapped in a marriage. 'He squirrelled her away and did not report the birth until months later to make it look like the child was conceived after they wedded. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings . Lita was granted a $800,000 settlement when the couple eventually divorced in 1927 . 'She was quite a young woman when they divorced and she was being sent by her lawyers to get as much as they could. She has said she regretted it in later life. 'It was way above and beyond what is standard for divorce proceedings, even for now.' Eventually in 1927, Lita and Chaplin divorced and she was granted a settlement of $800,000, the largest at the time. Mr Morrish said: 'She achieved what her lawyers wanted. In the end she got what she wanted but he still had a fantastic career after that.'"
"Charles Tillman has concluded his storied 12-year career with the Chicago Bears. The veteran cornerback has agreed a deal with the Carolina Panthers with the two-time Pro Bowler opting to link-up with Ron Rivera. At the age of 34 and after another injury-hit season, the new Bears hierarchy did not express an interest in keeping Tillman on the roster. But he leaves Chicago with his achievements on the field matched by those off it. Charles Tillman has ended his Chicago career but remains a favourite for  his work on and off the field . Drafted in the second round from Louisiana Lafeyette in 2003, Tillman became a staple of Lovie Smith's stingy defense, which propelled the Bears to Super Bowl XLI. A franchise record holder for defensive touchdowns and interception returns for touchdowns, the forced fumble specialist lies third on the all-time list for interceptions with 36. He started 152 of 156 games, but finished the past two seasons on injured reserve after tearing his right triceps. Tillman said the chance to work with Rivera - a former Bears player who worked as defensive co-ordinator from 2004-6 - was too good to turn down. Tillman holds several Bears defensive accolades and was a stalwart of their defense during his 12 years . 'I think Coach Rivera was one of the main reasons why I wanted to be here,' Tillman said. 'He's a guy that I had a lot of respect for when I was in Chicago. I love his leadership and his qualities as a coach, and he's done a good job with the Panthers. There's a good group of guys here like Thomas Davis, Greg Olsen, Luke Kuechly and Cam Newton. I got a good vibe here.' 'This is a similar defense, and Steve Wilks and (defensive line coach) Eric Washington were also in Chicago, so there is familiarity.' Since setting up the Cornerstone Foundation a decade ago, Tillman's charity has impacted over a million needy children and their families in the Chicago area. His work with the foundation was honoured with the Walter Payton Man of the Year award in 2014. In a quirk of fate, the Panthers also have the 2015 recipient of the award, Thomas Davis, on their roster."
"A teenager killed by police in Illinois on Saturday afternoon was shot twice in the back, an autopsy has revealed. Justus Howell, 17, died when officers fired one bullet into his heart and another through his shoulder. Police responding to news of 'an argument' at 2pm had chased Justus down the street before opening fire, according to a spokesman for Zion Police. The high school senior, who had moved to the area from Wisconsin in February, was pronounced dead at the scene. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon . His mother, LaToya Howell, told Fox News Justus wanted to be a surgeon. 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police,' she said. 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' A resident who lives feet from the scene, Bobbie Vaughan, spoke to Fox to describe what she heard. The teenager, who had moved to Zion from Wisconsin in February, wanted to be a surgeon, his mother said . Witnesses said they heard an officer say they had shot the boy. It is not known if a cop is suspended over it . 'I heard the officer tell the other officer, ""I shot him,""' she said. 'They were shaking him, but he didn't move. 'He was on his stomach, so they turned him over and the police officer I was with gave him CPR.' According to the Chicago Tribune, officers tended to the teenager before he was taken to hospital. It is not known whether an officer has been suspended while the shooting is investigated. The Zion police chief didn't return calls Monday seeking comment about the autopsy results. Toxicology results are pending. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"An elderly woman is in critical condition after being run over by her husband as he smashed into three cars whilst attempting to parallel park. The woman, 84, is thought to have been helping her husband park when the car accelerated into  her, resulting in a serious head injury. She also suffered injuries to her throat and legs, as well as various broken bones, and one onlooker said the woman was 'covered in blood'.

"Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel. The former child star turned Real Housewife discusses her demons in an emotional interview with Dr. Phil set to air April 28, her first for a national audience since the arrest. Among the topics the 50-year-old is slated to discuss is her longtime struggle with alcoholism. About her April 16 arrest, Richards reveals, 'I was angry and frightened and I was scared. I knew what I had done. The whole night is my fault. None of this would have happened if I didn’t drink.' Richards - who has been to rehab three times - was charged with with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting arrest and battery on a police officer and arrested at the Beverly Hills Hotel last week. Sat with Dr. Phil: Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel . Contradicting reports: Some sources involved in production of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills say that Kim Richard's protestations that she was sober last season were laughable - while others say she was doing better than ever . Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10 following her April 16 incident at the Polo Lounge where she 'caused a disturbance at the hotel restaurant and was taken into custody at the Beverly Hills Police Department.' According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunk actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed.' But that wasn't the only cause. Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling Stage IV cancer - continues to lean on her for support, which fans were able to watch on the recent RHOBH season. 'A big part of all of this is that she is just stressed out,' the pal explained. 'She is under a lot of pressure, especially because of Monty. While Kim Richards staunchly defended herself during the last season of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills - maintaining that she no longer struggles with substance abuse - reports from the cast and crew tell a different story. Several sources involved in production told TMZ that Kim's recent protestations that she was sober were laughable. And while veteran cast members Kyle Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Yolanda Foster learned to look the other way to avoid drama, Lisa Rinna and Eileen Davidson were the ones to confront the star. Insiders say that the 50-year-old would never drink where people could see her, sometimes drinking in the bathroom and emerging drunk. However, other sources from the show say that Kim was doing a better job than ever of keeping her addiction under control. Interestingly, Brandi Glanville - who was one of Kim's closest friends during season five - sided with both camps, depending on who you talked to. They knew better: Veteran cast members such as Kim's sister Kyle, Yolanda Foster and Lisa Vanderpump all chose to look away during the last season to avoid confrontation . Speaking out: Eileen Davidson (third left) and Lisa Rinna (second from right) were the two who chose to confront Kim about her issues during season five . One crew member revealed that Kim's sobriety was called into question several months ago after the incident where the mother-of-four's dog bit her sister Kyle's daughter Alexia. When a dog trainer was sent to her house to assess the situation Kim was reportedly such a mess he had to help put her to bed. Kim was arrested on Thursday morning after a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel where she had to be dragged out of a bathroom after refusing to leave the premises. She was taken to jail and cited with trespass, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and drunk in public. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the former child star may be booted off the Bravo show as producers feel she has become a liability due to her issues with substance abuse. Playing both sides: Insiders say that Brandi Glanville (centre) - who was one of Kim's closest plas during the last season - sides with both camps . Confirmed: Details of Kim's arrest were revealed in a statement from the Beverly Hills police department . Since she first appeared on the hit reality show in 2010, her sobriety has been her major storyline, with her recent relapse as the driving force between Kim and Kyle's distant relationship. TMZ alleges that Bravo are concerned that due to the nature of the show, they could be held accountable if something was to happen to Kim. There have been no permanent decisions made however, according to the gossip site. The next season of RHOBH has a few months before production picks up again so the final decision has yet to be concrete. Distressed: The mother-of-four reportedly started drinking after watching all three RHOBH reunion shows on Wednesday night ."
"Everyone is watching Valencia’s 19-year-old left back Jose Luis Gaya with Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea hoping to snatch him from under Real Madrid’s nose this summer. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson takes a look at the Spain under 21 defender. Why are English clubs so keen? His buy-out clause is currently set at £13.5m. When you consider that Luke Shaw – of a similar age and potential – cost £27m it would be silly not to be interested; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the Premier League. Jose Luis Gaya (right) in action for Valencia during a La Liga match with Sevilla earlier this season . Reservations? He flies forward very much in the style of Jordi Alba and Juan Bernat. But those two left-backs who came before him at Valencia are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers – one at Barca and the other for Pep Guardiola at Bayern. There would be more defensive duties in England and he would be tested in the air. He has plenty of spring and good technique but at just 5ft 7ins it is not his strong point. Basically, you’re saying he can’t defend… . No, not at all. He is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own, or his team-mates’ mistakes. He is also tenacious in the tackle – and aggressive enough to come out on top against bigger players. And he is 19 so a coach such as Mourinho would be able to improve him defensively. But what is indisputable is that his natural inclination is to attack. Gaya is an attack-minded left-back who likes to get forward at every opportunity . And he is very effective going forward? Much like the aforementioned Bernat and Alba, and Liverpool’s Alberto Moreno, he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full-back. He’s not just an overlapper, he’s very good off of both feet and can make runs inside to play through-balls or shoot. He also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11-year-old whose idol was David Villa, he scored 60 goals one season in Valencia’s academy. Spain already seem to be well-stocked at left-back so will he make it to the senior first team? He has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time Juan Bernat has moved up an age category, stepping into his place. He is currently first choice for the Under-21s. Of course at senior level everyone stops moving up and as good as he is it will be hard for him to shift Alba and Bernat ahead of France 2016. Gaya slides in on Atletico Madrid midfielder Arda Turan during last month's match in Madrid . Does he want to leave Valencia? He has supported the club all his life. Hour-long trips from his home in Alicante to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that £13m buy-out clause. If the offer is right and from the right club then he is ambitious and he will go. Will he come to England? Valencia would rather do business with an English club than Real Madrid. But if the buy-out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes. He’s 20 in May and staying in Spain will be appealing. At Madrid he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the East coast. He will want some guarantees at Madrid however. Marcelo is first choice at the moment so how many games will he actually play? A club like Arsenal could come in and promise far more first-team football which might sway him but Madrid are favourites. Gaya, pictured here at the 2013 Under 20 World Cup, has represented Spain up to under 21 standard . Gaya (left) talks to team-mate Federico Vico during an under 19 international against Germany . Real Madrid bought Danillo this week and now they want Gaya. And they already have Dani Carvajal and Mareclo. Are they building a team of full-backs? Reserve full-backs Alvaro Arbeloa and Fabio Coentrao have been identified as two of the weaknesses of the squad. They want Danillo and Carvajal contesting the right back position next season, and Gaya and Marcelo the left-back spot. Coentrao and Arebeloa will both be sold in the summer. There is also a Fifa investigation into their signing of under-age youngsters currently ongoing. With a potential transfer ban hanging over them they want to cover every gap in their squad."
"Wellness warrior Belle Gibson sensationally admitted yesterday in a tell-all interview that she had made up her terminal brain cancer diagnosis. The 23-year-old founder of The Whole Pantry app came clean about her circumstances, telling the Australian Women's Weekly, 'none of it's true'. In the interview, Gibson asked her former fans and customers who purchased her app and books to see her as only 'human'. Leading psychologist Jo Lamble told Daily Mail Australia that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders. Scroll down for video . Life-long struggle with the truth: Belle Gibson sensationally admitted that her terminal cancer was a lie in an interview with the Australian Women's Weekly . Lamble has not treated Gibson personally but said, in her professional opinion, she believes Gibson could be displaying signs of both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lack of remorse is a common trait seen in those with anti-social personalities, Lamble says. 'A lack of remorse definitely fits in. It's like - you do what you need to do to get what you want,' she said. 'So if they need money they will commit fraudulent acts and steal, for example.' While other experts suggested to AWW that she could be suffering Munchhausen Syndrome, Lamble believes this isn't likely to be the case for Gibson. Changing times: 'In the past, a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand,' says Lamble . 'With Munchhausen, they normally don’t just lie, they go much further to be sick. 'While they definitely fake illness, they also self-harm and don’t normally do it for money purposes, they do it for attention,' she said. 'For example, they will go to lots of different doctors and shop around until someone believes their symptoms. They also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves, then ask, ""what’s wrong with me?'' 'So I think in this particular case,  she’s made up a story for fame, fortune, signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism,' added Lamble. Another common trait shared by narcissists is that sufferers are often very charismatic. 'A lack or remorse definitely fits in... you do want you need to do to get what you want': Leading psychologist Jo Lamble says that Gibson's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder . 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune. They love to believe they are special and need all this admiration and attention,' the psychologist said. Lamble says this can often be a sign of neglect. This fits with Gibson's account of a troubled childhood - she was quoted in the Women's Weekly saying she had to bring herself up - doing the dishes and cooking her own food from a very young age, for example. According to Lamble, the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are... 1. They deceive and lie . 2. They lack remorse . 3. They can be  impulsive and irresponsible . 4. They don’t respect the law . 5. They don’t mind if they hurt family and friends, anyone is open to being deceived . 6. They are very charming and charismatic . 7. They have a certain attractiveness and draw people in . 8. They show a real interest in people . 9. Passionate about things . 'Neglect can lead someone to develop really unhealthy strategies to seek the love and attention they missed out on,' says Lamble. 'In the past, a need for love and attention may have emerged in less dangerous ways  - a lie here, a lie there - but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand. 'Social media has become the perfect way to gain that, we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers -  let alone hero worship, worldwide fans and book deals,' she said. 'I worry about future generations with things like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and people constantly needing excessive praise.' Lamble says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading. 'Everyone laughs about Dr Google and how if you have some condition you should see an expert but that goes for all these self styled gurus in anything. 'We might want to buy into a story, it's very appealing for people to love somebody who can turn something around and survive and particularly so if they are very marketable but any idolisation of someone isn't healthy. 'With massive followings and a glamorous story, young minds will follow that and believe it. Our poor doctors must have people coming in every day and people saying this is what I'm doing and why. Let’s look at the science,' she said. 'They love to believe they are special': 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune, says psychologist Jo Lamble (pictured left). She believes Belle Gibson (pictured right) may suffer from a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lamble also believes that Gibson could struggle to change without help. 'She might change her name and come up with some other scheme unless she shows genuine remorse, seeks help, and develops some insight. With what she is displaying, the prognosis is quite poor.' According to the interview, Gibson's new management will be organising for a psychologist to see her."
"The baggage handler who caused an emergency landing when he woke up inside the cargo hold of an airborne flight has come forward for the first time to detail the frightening experience, but still won't explain how he fell asleep to begin with. Willa Junior sat down with ABC News for an interview, and says he was exhausted and dozed off while loading a plane at Seattle-Tacoma Airport on April 13 and woke up when a piece of luggage landed on his head. The airport worker, who appears to be in his early 20s according to Facebook, wouldn't explain how he had the time to take a nap on the plane but says it used to be common practice: 'I mean when I first started the job, we took naps.' Scroll down for video . Taking responsibility: Willa Junior is the Seattle-Tacoma baggage handler who fell asleep in the cargo hold of a plane earlier this month, and became trapped inside when the plane took off . Making headlines: Junior, who appears to be in his early 20s according to Facebook, sat down for an interview with ABC News to speak about the harrowing and embarrassing experience . Nap time: Junior says he was exhausted when he dosed off while loading an Alaska Airlines flight on April 13. Above, a picture of Junior being rescued from the cargo hold after the plane was forced to turn around . Rude awakening: Junior woke up when a piece of luggage landed on him and then he called 911 - but his call cut out after just 44 seconds . Since it was pitch black inside the cargo hold, Junior was at first confused and disoriented but then quickly realized that the plane was moving. 'In my mind, I said, ""This is not happening. This is just a joke.""' Junior . His first move was to call his company, Menzies Aviation, which provides baggage services for airlines. But the person who answered the call at the office thought it was a prank call and just hung up. Desperately, Junior next called 911 and struggled to communicate to the dispatcher his unusual and unlikely situation. 'Hello, I'm trapped in this plane,' Junior tells the operator in audio released of the 911 call. 'You're where?' the dispatcher asks. 'I'm inside a plane.I feel like it's moving in the air. Flight 448. Can you please sent someone to stop it?' Junior says. Unfortunately the phone call cut out after 44 seconds and then Junior was on his own. That's when he started to lose hope, sending a text message to his mother saying he loved her, afraid he was going to die. Last words: Junior says he was scared he was going to die, so he sent a text message to his mother, saying he loved her. The area Junior was trapped in was pressurized and temperature controlled, so his life was never threatened . Help me! After his call to 911 cut out, Junior started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and passengers and crew heard, prompting the flight to turn around . Turn around: The pilot headed back to Seattle after just 14 minutes in the air. Junior says he is sorry for the passengers whose flight to Los Angeles he delayed . Luckily that was never the case since the cargo hold where Junior fell asleep is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was never in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. What saved Junior from being trapped on the flight for it's two and a half hour journey to Los Angeles was his decision to start banging on the roof of the cargo floor. 'I was yelling, ""Help me, somebody’s down here,""' he said. Junior's cries for help were so loud that passengers and crew members heard and the plane was turned around after just 14 minutes in the air. Junior is currently still employed at Menzies, but he has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines flights - one of the biggest airlines that fly our of Sea-Tac Airport. He says he is incredibly sorry for all of the trouble his nap caused, especially to the passengers whose plane he delayed. Employed: Junior is currently still employed at Menzies, but he has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines flights - one of the biggest airlines that fly our of Sea-Tac Airport ."
"Andy Murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow British tennis players who might be agitated about the imminent arrival of Aljaz Bedene into the home ranks: don’t complain. Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world No 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene’s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Aljaz Bedene is pictured at his British citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday morning . Andy Murray says British players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking . Bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in Hatfield . Last year, when Bedene stated he intended to try to make the switch, the then British No 3 Dan Evans expressed some doubts about its legitimacy, wondering why he would wish to do it. But Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. ‘If he was 500 in the world they wouldn’t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit,’ said the 27-year-old Scot. ‘And he’s obviously the British No 2, comfortably. ‘So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He’s British now so they’ve just got to deal with it. ‘I would hope that all the guys who are below him now, like James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup ties then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. ‘He’s a good player but so are James and Kyle, and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he’s on the tour every week, the other guys aren’t quite there yet.’ Murray admits Bedene's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week . James Ward (left) and Kyle Edmund should try to use Bedene as motivation to get better as a player . Bedene (right) with girlfriend Kimalie, who is a pop singer in her native land of Slovenia . For the first time, Murray, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene: ‘He’s a good player with a very good serve. He’s a legitimate top-100 player, when he plays challengers he’s there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main tour he wins matches, it’s not like he turns up and always loses in the first round. ‘He had a bad (wrist) injury last year but has recovered well. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings, although I don’t know exactly how high he can go. I’ve practised with him a couple of times, I haven’t seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would imagine he’s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while.’ Bedene can individually represent any country he wants where he holds a passport. The Davis Cup is a greyer area as from January 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the Slovenian squad three times — but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process. It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give support to his case but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: ‘To have another player in the men’s top 100 is clearly a positive thing and so we very much welcome Aljaz’s change in citizenship.’ Murray says Bedene is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings . Murray gets pumped up on his way to victory over Kevin Anderson at the Miami Open . Murray proudly poses with a cake, saying 'It's an amazing feeling' after winning his 500th game . Switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and Evans’s questions have some pertinence to them. There is a recent precedent, however. Two years ago Australian Brydan Klein switched to represent GB by virtue of his mother originally being from Manchester. He subsequently struggled but his form has picked up and he is now ranked 210 in the world to make himself the national No 5. Last year that would have guaranteed a Wimbledon wildcard worth, minimally, a staggering £27,000. However, there is now no automatic recommendation for a Championships wildcard for Brits ranked inside the top 250. The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally popular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairness to him, he proved true to his word. The Great Britain Davis Cup team celebrate their victory against the USA in Glasgow last month ."
"Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'"
"Two women who were part of a group that repeatedly searched Mississippi's capital city for black people to assault were sentenced Thursday to multiple years in federal prison for their role in the 2011 hate killing of 47-year-old James Craig Anderson. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate on Thursday sentenced Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21, of Pearl to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police. In a separate hearing earlier Thursday, Wingate also sentenced Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, of Crystal Springs to five years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit a hate crime. Went in search of black men to assault: Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21 (left) was sentenced to 8 years in prison and Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, (left) was given 5 years for their role in the horrific 2011 murder of 47-year-old Jackson, Mississippi man James Craig Anderson . Horrific: Graves and Richards were in the car when a group of white teens drove from their suburban town after a party with the specific intent of assaulting black men in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica'. James Anderson was one of their victims. He died after being beaten and run over by a truck . Both women were riding in a truck that fatally ran over Anderson in June 2011. Anderson died after being beaten and run over. Both women read letters of apology to Anderson's bereaved family, writes the Clarion-Ledger. 'It was the worst decision of my life,' Richards said as she wept. 'I followed a lot of people with hate in their hearts...and I'm sorry for the actions I didn't take to save Mr. Anderson's life.' Graves told the court she's haunted every day by Anderson's face. 'I was a teenager who partied too much and wanted to fit in with the crowd, and I've asked myself so many times, 'Why was I so afraid?' Graves said. 'I pray that not only God and Mr. Anderson can forgive me, but that his family can one day forgive me.' Their day of sentencing was not that day. Anderson's sister told the girls: . 'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire.' Hiding their faces: The family of Shelbie Richards hide their faces from photographers outside the federal courthouse in Jackson following Richards' sentencing Thursday . Lost a brother: Anderson's sister Barbara Anderson Young told Richards and Graves in court Thursday, 'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire' Maximum sentence: Attorney Merrida Coxwell reflects on the sentencing of his client Shelbie Brooke Richards to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police . Unthinkable: Hotel surveillance video obtained by  media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Anderson's partner James Bradfield was similarly unforgiving. The days are never the same. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries...On a sunny day, all I can see is Craig out there working in the yard, trying to do everything he could for his family, and you took his life for no reason,' he said. 'And you didn't want to turn yourself in. You thought you'd get away with it.' Six white men, sentenced earlier by a different judge, received prison terms ranging from four to 50 years for Anderson's death. Two more men await sentencing after Thursday's hearings. Both Richards and Graves have acknowledged that they helped recruit people at a birthday party to take part in the venture that eventually led to Anderson's death in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica.' Richards admitted that she encouraged Deryl Paul Dedmon to assault Anderson when they arrived in a hotel parking lot, and then yelled a racial slur and encouraged Dedmon to run over Anderson when Dedmon returned to the truck. Hotel surveillance video obtained by The Associated Press and other media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Richards also acknowledged that later that month she lied to Jackson police detectives about the incident and her participation. The 10 defendants have pleaded guilty to other racially motivated attacks, including the beating of a black man near a Jackson golf course, the beating of another man who tried to sell the suburbanites drugs, attacks on pedestrians using beer bottles and a slingshot, and an attempt to run down another black man. Prosecutors said the suspects usually sought out people who were homeless or drunk. Other than Anderson, the black people who were assaulted have not been identified. Richards admitted that she encouraged Deryl Paul Dedmon (right) to assault Anderson when they arrived in a hotel parking lot, and then yelled a racial slur and encouraged Dedmon to run over Anderson when Dedmon returned to the truck ."
"Daredevil Nik Wallenda says he'll walk untethered on top of a 400-foot observation wheel in Orlando, Florida, this month. Wallenda said Monday at a New York City news conference that the Orlando Eye will be moving when he attempts his feat April 29. The Orlando Eye, part of a new entertainment complex, will offer views of central Florida from inside 30 enclosed, air-conditioned glass capsules when it opens to the public on May 4. Scroll down for video . Eyes on the prize: High-wire performer Nik Wallenda announces his latest stunt at the 400-foot Orlando Eye, during a news conference, in New York on Monday . Tough challenge: The 36-year-old daredevil will walk atop the Orlando Eye as it turns on April 29 . The Orlando Eye team issued a statement saying it's excited to have Wallenda attempt the 'amazing stunt.' No distance for the performance has been set yet, but Wallenda, 36, said he was not likely to walk the entire 20 minutes or so that it takes the wheel to go a full circle. Wallenda previously walked atop a Ferris wheel in Santa Cruz, California, but he said the size of the much larger Orlando wheel and the fact that he will not use a pole sets this stunt apart. The seventh-generation member of the 'Flying Wallenda' family of acrobats has walked across the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. In November, he walked twice between two Chicago skyscrapers without a net or harness, doing the second walk blindfolded. Wallenda is the great-grandson of Karl Wallenda, who fell to his death in Puerto Rico at 73."
"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists he is not concerned that Romelu Lukaku has joined forces with high-powered agent Mino Raiola ahead of a potential summer of transfer speculation surrounding the striker. Raiola, steeped in Italian and Dutch football, is one of the most influential agents in the game, with Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba and Liverpool’s Mario Balotelli among his high-profile clients. The Italian middleman has been involved in transfer deals worth over £400million and Lukaku’s decision to sever his links with Christophe Henrotay, who oversaw his Everton club record £28m move from Chelsea last summer, adds a possible new dimension to his career. Romelu Lukaku (left) poses alongside his new agent Mino Raiola in an Instagram picture . The appointment of Raiola as agent fuels speculation Lukaku (left) could be set for a move away from Everton . Roberto Martinez, the Everton manager, is unconcerned by Lukaku joining Raiola . The Belgium striker, 21, has scored only eight times in the Premier League so far this season compared with 15 last term. But he has netted 18 in total, including eight in the Europa League which spearheaded Everton’s run to the last 16. With Everton 13th in the Barclays Premier League there will be no European adventure next season but Martinez, who persuaded Lukaku to turn a season-long loan into a permanent five-year deal last summer, is adamant that the player’s switch of agents has not set the alarm bells ringing. Martinez said: ‘He has changed his agent, yes, but we are not concerned, no. Rom is entitled to do that. ‘Everyone speaks about the colourful character that Mino Raiola is but he has a lot of players who are very much people who are happy to stay at one club. ‘I dealt with Mino Raiola at Wigan and not many people know that he had Danny de Ridder or Vladimir Weiss, players who have been happy to stay at a club. I don’t think there is anything to read into that.’ Martinez does not expect a summer of upheaval at Goodison Park, despite the team’s disappointing campaign. Veteran defender Sylvain Distin, 37, who has not featured in the league since late December, will leave at the end of his contract but, according to Martinez, fellow centre back Antolin Alcaraz still has a chance to earn a new deal during the closing weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the manager insists 21-year-old midfielder Ross Barkley can build on his performances from the bench for England against Lithuania and Italy to finish an indifferent season on a high. ‘He will benefit from the experiences of this difficult season,’ added Martinez, whose side entertain Southampton on Saturday. Raiola has engineered big money moves for players such as Mario Balotelli at Liverpool . Martinez believes that Ross Barkley (left) will benefit from the difficult season that he has endured . ‘This is his second full season in an important role in the squad. ‘He enjoys that responsibility and taking responsibility in big games. ‘He has an incredible technical ability and, with the physicality he has, you don’t see many players in world football with those capabilities. ‘We know who Ross is and how important he is for the future of Everton.’"
"A woman charged with having sex with a dog has whacked a photographer over the head with a bottle and told him to 'f--k off' outside court on Saturday afternoon.

Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug and unlawful wounding . Ms Driscoll was arrested on Friday afternoon after she turned up at Stafford police station to fulfill her regular bail conditions. Police had allegedly issued a warrant for her arrest after she failed to appear in court on seven charges of supplying or trafficking drugs, one charge of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality. According to the Courier Mail, Ms Driscoll pleaded guilty before Magistrate Bronwyn Springer for failing to previously appear in court and was fined $250 for the offence . She was released on conditional bail, which requires her to report to police, abide by residential conditions and not speak to the complainant. Police found the videos of Ms Driscoll allegedly having sex with a dog while investigating text messages on her mobile phone for allegedly dealing cannabis in October. She fronted Brisbane court on Saturday for failing to previously appear on April 7 . Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos which allegedly show her having sex with a dog . Ms Driscoll was charged last year with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug. ‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland. Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends. Text messages showed that Driscoll had arranged for 113 grams of the drug to be sold for $1,150 and on another occasion 85 grams for $900, according to Sgt Pearson.

"When father-of-three Sean McCabe got the devastating news that he had just two months to live he set about organising the funeral - choosing the music and even booking the church. But in an extraordinary twist his cancer went into remission and he has now changed his reservation for his wedding to his fiancee Lisa Williams. Mr McCabe, 30, of Tonyrefail, south Wales, even wrote a goodbye letter to his children for his partner to read to them once he had died after he was told he had stage four Hodgkin Lymphoma. Scroll down for video . Sean McCabe planned his own funeral after he was told he had just two months to live, but after making a recovery he was told he was in remission and has rebooked the church for his wedding to Lisa Williams (left) 'When the doctors said my chances of survival were slim, all I could think about was Lisa and the kids. I didn't know how they would cope without me,' said Mr McCabe, a security guard. 'Planning my funeral seemed like a way of easing the strain for them, as it would be one less ordeal for them to deal with.' The father-of-three was diagnosed with cancer in June 2013, then aged 28, and was started on an intensive chemotherapy course. He was given the all-clear in September but just two months later told the cancer had returned in an even more aggressive form. He was expected to live for eight weeks. Mr McCabe was told his cancer had returned aggressively and is pictured after chemotherapy in 2014 . Doing all he could to cope with his diagnosis, Mr McCabe booked St David's Church for his funeral, in late January 2014. He instructed Miss Williams to ensure his favourite song, 'Who You Are' by Jessie J was played, and ordered mourners not to wear black. As preparations got underway he picked the site for his family to scatter his ashes, and penned a heart-wrenching letter to be read to his children after his death, telling them: 'I don't want to leave you or mammy, but I haven't got an option.' But he managed to make a remarkable recovery and was told his cancer is now in remission. He said: 'A year ago I was planning my funeral at that church, and now I'm planning our wedding there.

"Per Mertesacker looks set to be ruled out of Arsenal’s derby against Chelsea although the  defender has escaped any serious ankle ligament damage. Mertesacker, captain during the long absence of Mikel Arteta, limped off during the second half of the FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley on Saturday.

"Schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski (pictured) did not offer a word of remorse as he was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering a nine-year-old . Calais schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a range of crimes which are likely to see him jailed for life, prosecutors said today. The 38-year-old appeared before a judge on Friday night and was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering the nine-year-old identified solely by her first name of Chloe. Despite being banned from France for earlier offences, Zbigniew was on his way to England on Wednesday from Calais when he struck. A statement released by Boulogne prosecutors said: 'The investigating judge conducted his indictment for the following reasons: rape of a minor, kidnapping and murder. 'During his interrogation, the person in custody had admitted his involvement in the alleged crimes, but failed to state the reasons for his action.' Confirming that Huminski had been 'placed in custody in a regional prison', his lawyer Antoine Deguines said: 'He did not speak to the judge, as his right. 'I have not been able to speak much with him, he does not talk much and, it seems, is in shock over what happened. It's hard for him to address the facts'. Asked if Zbigniew had offered any remorse, Mr Deguines said: 'No, he is saying very little about anything.' It came as thousands prepared to take to the streets of Calais on Saturday to take part in a second 'White March' to pay tribute to Chloe, whose funeral will take place in the port city's St Peter's Church on Wednesday. Mr Deguines confirmed Huminski had been on his way to see his sister in Southampton when he 'stopped for a beer' in Calais, and then attacked Chloe while drunk. Huminski was supposed to be in prison in Poland - but he exploited his home country's lax justice system to travel to France instead. This picture was the last taken of nine-year-old Chloe at 2.31pm - she is seated in front of her family home. Relatives have put this photograph at the scene where she was kidnapped . The career criminal was sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but under the rules in Poland, he was supposed to take himself to jail. But he hit the road for France and, under the EU's free movement rules, there was nothing to stop him driving across Europe. Nine-year-old Chloe, seen in a last haunting photo posing with a carefree grin in the playground outside her home, was snatched as her terror-stricken mother tried helplessly to reach her. Huminski has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (pictured) Before Isabelle Hyart could do anything, Huminski bundled Chloe into his car and drove her to woodland where he sexually assaulted and strangled her. Huminski has a long criminal record in France and Poland, including once attacking a frail woman of 78 with a knife in her home. He was convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early in March 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Ms Hyart, a mother of two other young children, said: 'I'm appalled, disgusted. I don't understand why he was in France. And why did he come to Calais? I don't understand how anyone could do that to a child of nine.' Ms Hyart said the brazen abduction happened in broad daylight on Wednesday when she left her daughter in the playground to pop back inside the flat to change her four-year-old son's clothing. Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his long criminal record in France and Poland. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: 'How could a foreigner with many previous convictions be allowed to move freely around Calais? There is a clear dysfunction in the way we keep track of repeat offenders.' Last summer, Alice Gross, 14, was murdered by a Latvian builder who moved to the UK after serving a prison sentence for killing his wife. Arnis Zalkalns, 41, spent seven years in jail in Latvia but was still allowed in to Britain without having his record checked. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a full investigation in to Huminski's past, saying Chloe's family deserved the 'whole truth'. Christine Taubira, the justice minister, also demanded a 'complete, precise and rapid' investigation.' The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken .

"Andy Hornby is non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U, which was found to be selling NHS patients' details on without their knowledge . The chairman of the online pharmacy site found to be selling NHS patients’ data without their knowledge is the shamed former chief executive of HBOS. A Mail investigation yesterday told how the personal details of thousands of users of Pharmacy 2U are being sold to companies that target the sick. Now we can reveal that at its helm is the disgraced banker Andy Hornby, who was in charge of HBOS when it collapsed in 2008. Mr Hornby last night faced calls to step down from his role as non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U and was condemned for profiting from the sale of his customers’ personal data. Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society – either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled. Others who use the NHS-approved pharmacy website used its online doctor consultations. Their details – which included email addresses and dates of birth – were passed on without proper consent. When Mr Hornby joined the company, the UK’s leading online pharmacy, in 2012, it said in a statement: ‘The imminent transition to electronic prescriptions across the NHS represents an exciting opportunity for Pharmacy 2U, and Andy’s insights and leadership will be of significant value.’ It is not known how much Mr Hornby – who works two to three days a week – is earning from the Leeds-based company, but it is thought he received a significant salary increase last year. He is also a principle shareholder. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, last night called for Mr Hornby to step down and for a criminal investigation into Pharmacy 2U. She said: ‘He should be called to account for what his company is doing and issue a public statement. He needs to be made to sit down and explain why patient information is being sold on.’ She added that the health select committee should launch an inquiry into the issue after the election. Pharmacy 2U, an online prescription service, sold details including the patients’ email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to marketing firms . Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society – either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled . Following the financial crash in the autumn of 2008, a devastating report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards accused Mr Hornby and fellow former bosses of ‘catastrophic failures’ as they presided over years of reckless lending. His current role is his third job since then. In 2011 he unexpectedly quit as £1million-a-year chief executive of healthcare group Alliance Boots, a move blamed on stress. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, called for Mr Hornby to step down . Four months later he became boss of Coral, a position he still holds. In 2013, he faced calls to quit amid reports the bookmaker was set for a £2billion flotation. Pharmacy 2U admitted that it had sold the names and addresses of ‘up to 5,000’ patients to data company Alchemy Direct but refused to say how much it had charged. It said it had decided to stop selling the information to Alchemy and stressed no medical data had been passed on. Last night Pharmacy 2U said that Mr Hornby is ‘not involved in day-to-day decisions about the running of the business’. A spokesman added: ‘We have asked the Information Commissioner’s Office to work with us to review our privacy policy and have also contacted the General Pharmaceutical Council, our industry regulator, and the NHS, to discuss this matter.’ NHS England said: ‘Any breach of confidentiality is totally unacceptable. This case will be reported to the Information Commissioner and General Pharmaceutical Council and there will be an immediate investigation.’"
"Chelsea do consider their sponsorship interests when the club buys a new player but the Blues would never sign someone who isn't good enough, insists manager Jose Mourinho. The west London club, who agreed a £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturers Yokohama Rubber in February, are believed to have made an offer for FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto. The 22-year-old international would be the first Japanese player to sign for Chelsea if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer, although Mourinho is adamant that commercial deals would never fully dictate his transfer policy. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto . Jose Mourinho admits that Chelsea do consider commercial deals when signing new players . Asked about Muto in his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's game against QPR, Mourinho said: 'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. 'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play. 'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.' FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid - understood to be around £4m - for Muto, who has 11 caps and one goal for his country. Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club . Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season . The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Asked about the influence of the Yokohama Rubber deal on his moves in the transfer market, Mourinho said: 'That's modern football. That's modern management. You cannot close the door completely to commercial interests. 'A football club is always a football club. We would never bring a player if the player has no capacity to be in a Chelsea football club squad.'"
"Dozens of public servants were less than humoured when they were told their jobs would be lost in a cruel April Fools' Day prank. The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were given an 'announcement' on a big TV screen that their workplace was being closed and moved to Melbourne. DFAT has since reprimanded the staff member responsible for the stunt, which saw 30 low-ranking employees told they needed to apply for expressions of interest if they wanted to keep their jobs by moving to Melbourne. The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were met with this 'announcement' on a big TV screen . The message was displayed for five hours before one of the centre's supervisors told workers that it was an April Fools' Day prank. The workers had good cause to fear for their jobs: DFAT is planning to cut 500 jobs by June. The main role of the employees involved in the parnk is to ensure passport applicants meet the requirements in a process known as 'ELLO'. The announcement said the office was undergoing 'substantial' changes and would be moving all 'ELLO' roles to Melbourne as a result. It comes as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tradeplans plans to cut 500 jobs by June this year . The Community and Public Sector Union's national secretary Nadine Flood said it was tasteless to joke about something perceived as a genuine fear, according to The Guardian. 'April Fool's jokes are supposed to be funny. There's nothing funny about fake job cuts when the Abbott government has cut 11,000 public service jobs for real in the last year,' she said."
"A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating. But many admit they know where they are going wrong . If you are thinking of attempting some DIY this weekend watch out – nearly seven in ten of us end up injured. A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent said they or their partner had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating. Two in five had injured their back, one in five had cut themselves and one in ten had suffered side effects from inhaling chemical fumes. A careless one in 30 suffered after getting paint or chemicals in their eyes and eight in 100 had fallen off a ladder, said research for the makers of pain relief brands Deep Heat and Deep Freeze. But a significant number of hapless handymen and women know where they're going wrong. One in 10 said they failed to follow instructions or research the right way to do the job, while one in five came to grief taking a shortcut. Men are a third more likely than women to try to cut corners when doing a job. Top of the nation's to-do list is DIY and decorating, with eight in 10 Brits catching up on everything from odd jobs to major makeovers round the home . However, it seems DIYers are failing to prepare properly for a weekend of exertions. More than a third confessed they did not prepare their bodies for the physical demands of their day of DIY. A similar number admitted they weren't used to physical work or were too out of shape for hard graft. Reassuringly, seven in 10 of those surveyed had a first-aid kit and of those did, four out of five had treatments specifically designed for muscle problems or injuries. DIY expert Grant James Crossley said: ‘There may be no escaping DIY and other household chores, but with a little preparation there’s a lot you can do to escape morning-after aches and muscle pain.’ The poll found two in five  people had injured their back, one in five had cut themselves and one in ten had suffered side effects from inhaling chemical fumes - and men are more likely than women to cut corners ."
"(CNN)A Saudi-led coalition Tuesday ended its ""Operation Decisive Storm"" -- its nearly monthlong airstrike campaign in Yemen -- and a new initiative is underway. ""Operation Renewal of Hope"" will focus on the political process. Saudi Arabia had launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that has overthrown the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda, which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in the capital Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives ""by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,"" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to ""nearly all demands"" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back Yemen's ""security and stability through establishing a political process,"" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Ousted Yemen President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi thanked the Saudi-led coalition. Hadi claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. ""We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,"" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at ""the right time"" to rebuild the country. ""You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,"" said Hadi. Also Tuesday, a U.S. military official told CNN that the United States is conducting ""manned reconnaissance"" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report."
"If the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play-offs, then watch out for Wolves. Kenny Jackett’s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory. Wolves substitute David Edwards races away in celebration after scoring a late winner . Edwards is congratulated by his Wolves team-mates following his 88th-minute winner against Leeds . Wolves striker Benik Afobe slides on his knees after scoring his side's third goal of the afternoon . WOLVES (4-4-2): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Golbourne; Henry (Van la Parra 78mins), McDonald, Price, Sako; Afobe, Dicko (Edwards 70) Subs not used: Kuszczak, Doherty, Doyle, Ebanks-Landell, Hause . Booked: Golbourne, Batth . Goals: Dicko 19, 45, Afobe 48, Edwards 88 .

Booked: Wooton, Byram, Bamba . Goal: Taylor 11, Batth OG 65, Mowatt 74 . Referee: David Coote . Attendance: 25,169 . With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday’s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds’ banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett’s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves’ rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder’s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price’s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt’s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of ‘leave it’ could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald’s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place. Leeds United celebrate after Charlie Taylor puts Neil Redfearn's side in the lead during the Molineux clash ."

"(CNN)They took Yarmouk by storm, a sea of masked men flooding into the streets of one the world's most beleaguered places. Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area. ""They slaughtered them in the streets,"" one Yarmouk resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. ""They (caught) three people and killed them in the street, in front of people. The Islamic State is now in control of almost all the camp."" An estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside Yarmouk, stuck between ISIS and Syrian regime forces in ""the deepest circle of hell,"" in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp. The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp in an effort to drive out armed groups. Activists and residents in Yarmouk tell CNN that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since ISIS stormed the camp, but have no place to go. Hundreds have been injured, but the camp's only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS, then targeted last week by regime shelling. As the fighting raged in Yarmouk, the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived. ""We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities,"" Wesam Sabaneh told CNN. ""The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday, so there's really nothing functioning."" Opinion: Save the 'miracle babies' Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task. Majed Alomari, the Jafra Foundation's water coordinator, was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups. The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria (PLHR), who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012, said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help. ""According to my contacts inside, people are back to consuming water with spices -- a common meal used in 2014"" during the Syrian regime's siege of the camp, the PLHR's Salim Salamah told CNN. Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government's stranglehold on the camp last year, and delivered aid to tens of thousands. But now, as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides, residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge, or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death. ""Now I am scared of two things -- I am scared of (ISIS) and the regime,"" the Yarmouk resident told CNN. ""The regime now is about to destroy the Yarmouk camp,"" he said. ""And ISIS, I don't know ... they didn't do anything except [rename] Yarmouk Camp as 'Yarmouk Islamic State.'"""
"A group of Muslim migrants have been arrested for 'aggravated murder' after allegedly throwing 12 Christians into the Mediterranean sea during a recent crossing from Libya, Italian police reports. Witnesses say a fight broke out on a rubber dinghy carrying more than 100 African migrants from Libya to Sicily, after which the men were thrown to their deaths. A group of 15 men have now been arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate,' Palermo police said in a statement. Murders: A fight over religion broke out on a boat carrying 105 migrants from Libya, after which 12 men 'professing the Christian faith' were thrown to their deaths. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centers after disembarking from in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . Italian police say they were informed of the alleged attacks by a group of Nigerian and Ghanaian survivors upon their arrival in Palermo, Sicily yesterday. The survivors said they had boarded a rubber boat on the Libyan coast on April 14, which had 105 passengers aboard. During the crossing, a fight broke out over religion, with the group of Muslim passengers threatening the Nigerians and Ghanaians after the latter declared themselves to be Christians. 'The threats then materialised and 12 people, all Nigerian and Ghanaian, are believed to have drowned in the Mediterranean,' the police statement added. The 15 migrants arrested over the attack on their arrival in Palermo are from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau.

This week, Italian coastguards intercepted more than 42 boats attempting to make the crossing to Europe . The police statement said their motive for the attack was that the victims 'professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim.' This followed reports earlier today of a shipwreck feared to have cost 41 lives off the Italian coast. Four men, two Nigerians, a Ghanaian and one from Niger, who had been rescued while floating in the Mediterranean by an Italian Navy helicopter reported the shipwreck once they arrived in the Italian port of Trapani today. They said had left Tripoli in Libya on Saturday and stayed adrift for four days. The new tragedies come just days after aid agencies reported 400 presumed dead in the sinking of another ship near the Libyan coast. The deaths have raised calls for a more robust search and rescue of the seas between Libya and Europe amid a surge in migration between the Middle East and Africa toward Italy."
"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists Manchester City can come from behind again to snatch the Barclays Premier League title from Chelsea.

It’s the easy bit giving it to him. Another bit of brilliance wins the game and gives everyone a lift.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Henderson told him there was no chance he was missing the fixture once the baby had arrived. Rodgers explained: 'His wife had a second child during the night so he had to go away, hadn't slept so much, travelled all the way back again and put in the performance he did tonight.

Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). Rodgers thought the much-publicised review meeting he held with Liverpool's players on Sunday paved the way for them to get back to winning ways in the FA Cup. The Reds boss had denied a report that an internal meeting following the 4-1 defeat to Arsenal had descended into crisis talks and his players responded on the pitch by booking their spot in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley with a hard-fought 1-0 replay victory over Blackburn. 'There was a lot made of that,' he said. 'I'm a coach who speaks openly to players. Part of the coaching philosophy for me is about reviewing and reflecting performance. 'It's something that we've done all year when we were winning games. That provides us the lever to move forward - how can we be better, how can we improve? 'Because we lost a couple of games, there's a lot been made of that meeting but that review was very, very important in how we want to work. If you don't review and analyse your performance how can you get better?'"
"One of the most widespread 'food rules' passed down from generation to generation may actually be a myth. The five-second rule, which has been cited to justify picking up everything from a salt and vinegar chip to an assortment of cold cuts, is not as sure-fire as many snackers would surely like it to be. Experts have largely dismissed the almost magical powers surrounding the five-second rule, but said what type of food and where you drop it does come into play. Scroll down for video . One of the most widespread 'food rules' passed down from generation to generation may actually be a myth, meaning this tart isn't safe to pick up . 'There's no such things as a 'five-second rule',' Food Safety Information Council spokeswoman Rachelle Williams told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a myth; we definitely do not recommend it.' However, Ms Williams said we need to consider the type of food before picking something up off the floor and eating it. 'It all comes down to bacteria,' she said. Video courtesy of RMIT . Experts say dry foods, like cookies, are less hazardous and can be OK, according to health experts . Uncut fruit is one group considered non-hazardous, however cut fruits should never be subjected to the five-second rule . 'Bacteria relies on moisture to grow, so any food wet food is considering potentially hazardous. It's much easier for bacteria to grow on those foods. 'With dry foods, it is conversely much tougher for bacteria to grow.' Dry foods are things such as potato chips, lollies, nuts, biscuits, crackers and uncooked rice or pasta. Potato chips and nuts fall into the 'maybe' area of the five-second rule . Meat, such as cold-cuts and salami, are definitely not worth the risk, and can be a breeding ground for bacteria . If you drop some uncooked rice, it can be safe to pick it up and throw in the pan. However, cooked rice is very dangerous . Dry foods are things such as potato chips, lollies, nuts, biscuits, crackers and uncooked rice or pasta. Wet foods are cut fruit, cold meats, ham, salami, dairy products, and cooked rice or pasta. The comments come after the Food Safety Information Council released a food safety report card as part of World Health Day on April 7. Crakers and nuts have a lower risk than wet foods . Sausages should never be picked up - five-second rule or not . More than 4.1 million cases of food poisoning are diagnosed in Australia every year, with 31,920 hospitalisations and 82 deaths. However, the number is coming down, which experts credited to an increased basic understanding of food safety. ‘Australian consumers get an A plus for knowledge...', Food Safety Information Council Chair Professor Michael Eyles said. ‘But there are a number of other food safety practices where there can be ‘room for improvement.' Mr Eyles identified cooking food thoroughly, being aware of and sticking to use-by dates, and ensuring it is stored at the right temperature as important areas of focus."
"(CNN)She predicted events that unfolded in the Middle East well before they happened. And her book on Iraq became required reading for many military leaders trying to understand the country. Veteran journalist and author Sandra Mackey died Sunday, her son, Colin Mackey, said. She was 77. Her extensive career began in anonymity. She was an undercover reporter working for U.S. newspapers from Saudi Arabia as her husband, Dr. Dan Mackey, worked in a Riyadh hospital. For four years, she hid her writing from the authorities and smuggled her stories out of the country to get around Saudi Arabia's prohibition on foreign journalists. Her work appeared under the pseudonym Michael Collins. As she chronicled what was happening around her, Mackey's distinctive voice began to emerge. Over the years, a stream of books followed. ""The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom"" offered ""a rare first-hand glimpse into the hidden realm of Saudi social and public life,"" The New York Times wrote. Her 1992 book ""Passion and Politics: The Turbulent World of the Arabs"" helped bridge gaps in understanding between Arabs and Americans, critics wrote. Mackey wrote for the people she knew, in a layman's language that was rooted in her training as a high school history teacher. ""Scholars may be put off by Mackey's occasionally florid, bombastic language, but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain Arab perspectives to Americans,"" Elizabeth R. Hayford wrote in Library Journal. After earning a history degree from the University of Central Oklahoma, Mackey attended the University of Virginia to study international relations. She graduated in the first class of women admitted to the graduate program. For her book on Iran, Mackey was three times able to win permission to travel through the country unaccompanied, allowing her to paint an intimate portrait of a country going through extraordinary change. Her 2002 book ""The Reckoning -- Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein"" portended some of the outcomes of the war in Iraq -- but also drew some sharp criticism. ""If war prevails, we shall beget a greater disorder in the Persian Gulf,"" Mackey wrote in the book. ""We will be sucked into the resentments of the Arab world, the hostilities of the Iraqis, and the challenge of nation building in what has become an intensely tribal society at the core of American vital interests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.'' Fouad Ajami, the late Hoover Institute fellow who was also a frequent guest on CNN, took issue with the book. ""The crowds in Baghdad and Basra (like the crowds in Kabul that greeted their liberators with kites and music) may yet embarrass Mackey and the countless naive people who see things her way,""  Ajami wrote for The New York Times' Sunday Book Review cover story in 2002. Mackey had an Oklahoma twang, the slightly nasal kind that she was proud of, but that belied her worldly understanding. She would use it to full effect when she wanted to put people at ease. Mackey was a frequent commentator on CNN during the Gulf War in the 1990s. She also appeared on countless other outlets, including Bill Maher's ""Politically Incorrect,"" to explain in layman's terms what was happening in the region. Her book on Iraq was published one year before the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. The book forewarned of the consequences of such action. ""In a perfect world, Shia, Sunni, and Kurd, followed by a company of other minorities, would walk into the post-Hussein Iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering,"" Mackey wrote. ""But as all those who plot the way of nations are so acutely aware, the world is not perfect."" She said those calling for an invasion of Iraq ""cannot ignore the threats to American security that could come with Hussein's demise."" ""With American troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge, the United States faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant Islam,"" Mackey said. ""... Thus, American military forces rotate in and out, U.S. taxpayer money finances the occupation, and Iraqi hostility to a Western presence increases. There is no exit strategy except retreat."" In 2004 the U.S. military actually flew Mackey to Iraq to teach commanders from the Army's 1st Infantry Division while the war was still raging. Her book on Iraq became required reading for many military officers. ""I am literally a little old lady in tennis shoes,"" she used to joke about her ability to gain the confidence of countless sources.  ""What's the harm in talking to me?"""

Edinho recently made headlines after being convicted in a money laundering case that involved a drug gang. He is appealing a 33-year prison sentence. Edson Cholbi Nascimento, seen in this picture in 2002, has been hired as a coach of a Brazilian team . Mogi Mirim currently have former Brazil player Rivaldo serving as their president . Edinho's dad is Brazilian legend Pele, who won three World Cups in 1958, 1962 and 1970 . Rivaldo said Edinho will bring to his club the experience of having worked with several top coaches in Brazil, including Vanderlei Luxemburgo and Muricy Ramalho. The 44-year-old former goalkeeper was one of the assistant coaches for Santos, the club where his father thrived in the 1960s. Edinho briefly played for Santos in the 1990s.

"The Tories will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential Labour-SNP power-sharing deal by unveiling the party’s first ‘manifesto for England’. The Prime Minister and the outgoing Leader of the Commons William Hague will launch the English document, which follows traditional Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Its centrepiece will be a pledge to introduce a system of ‘English votes for English laws’ – giving English MPs an effective veto over legislation applying only to their constituents. Inflammatory: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) will be joined by William Hague (right) as they launch the English manifesto - with the latter expected to warn England risks being 'held to ransom' by SNP . Mr Hague is expected to warn that England risks being ‘held to ransom’ by Scottish Nationalists unless Labour agrees to implement such a reform. The manifesto is also expected to commit the Tories to dozens of new road schemes in England and an extension of the Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for expensive cancer treatments on the English NHS. The document will be seen as an attempt by the Tories to tap into growing English nationalism. Opponents are likely to criticise it as risking fostering division between the UK’s four nations. But a Tory strategist said: ‘We have separate Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Why shouldn’t there be one for England?’ The ‘English votes’ plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the Scottish Parliament is handed yet more powers. Mr Hague wants to strip Scottish MPs of the power to impose tax changes, education and health reforms on England, given Holyrood will soon control all these issues in Scotland. The reform would make it impossible for any future Labour government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in England without winning the support of a majority of English MPs. Tensions: The manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the Tories and nationalist parties like Nicola Sturgeon's SNP and Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood . It could also make it difficult for a Scottish MP to again hold the office of Chancellor or Prime Minister, given they would be unable to vote on some of their own Government’s legislation. For decades, Labour has relied on the votes of its power base of Scottish MPs to rule Westminster. But since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, critics have questioned how it can be right for Scots MPs to have the crucial say on issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents. Both reforms passed under Tony Blair’s government thanks to the votes of Labour’s tartan army of MPs. Mr Hague is expected to say that the scale of devolution now to be given to Scotland means the question of the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster is unavoidable. 'Calm smoothness': Cameron has insisted he has 'no end' of passion in an interview with The Spectator . David Cameron has admitted that what he called his ‘calm smoothness’ could give people the wrong impression about how urgently he wants to win the General Election. In an interview with The Spectator, the Prime Minister insisted he had ‘no end’ of passion but was a Conservative, a tribe of ‘practical, sensible, clear-headed’ people who ‘don’t always wear their beliefs on their sleeve’. Asked why many people believe he must do more to demonstrate that he really wants to win, he said: ‘I don’t know. There is something about me – I always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something. ‘But look, yesterday, where was I? I went to five seats, I did five speeches, I didn’t finish until way after the other party leaders were home having TV training or something. 'I was out on the stump and I’m doing the same today. Look at my schedule! I don’t know what more I can do.’ Mr Cameron yesterday faced one of his most hostile interviews so far in the campaign. Chris Smith, a Radio 1 Newsbeat presenter, repeatedly interrupted him and offered him a £1,000 bet that he would not win the election outright. Clearly irritated, the Prime Minister said: ‘Have you got some God-given right to declare what the result of the election is?’ He insisted that ‘there is every opportunity in the next 15 days for there to be a majority government’."
"Tottenham are confident Kyle Walker has not broken his foot following a scan on Tuesday. There were fears the England defender may have fractured his right foot after taking a hefty blow from a collision with Kieran Trippier during the draw at Burnley on Sunday. Results from the scan have shown up heavy bruising, but no fracture. However, more tests are planned this week. Tottenham defender Kyle Walker receives treatment from medical staff during the 0-0 draw with Burnley . Walker had sustained the injury following a heavy collision with Burnley defender Kieran Trippier at Turf Moor . Walker has been provided with a protective boot to ensure no further damage is caused. He will continue to be assessed by Spurs' medical team in the coming days as the club determine the full extent of the injury. But the early signs are that the 24-year-old will not be a long-term casualty, though a full diagnosis will be completed once swelling has fully subsided. Scans have revealed that Walker has not broken his foot and will hopefully return to action for Spurs soon ."
"(CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is ""service of process""? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go ""off the grid"". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is ""nail and mail"" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of ""service"" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, ""traditional"" doesn't necessarily mean ""good.""  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be ""liked"" by all your gawking ""friends,"" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we ""live"" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email."
"Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Let's start in Spain, where Marca and AS report that Real Madrid are set to be without Karim Benzema for their Champions League quarter-final second leg clash against rivals Atletico Madrid. The French striker, who has 15 La Liga goals to his name this season, missed Madrid's 3-1 victory against Malaga with a knee injury which he is struggling to recover from. Spanish newspapers  report that Karim Benzema will miss Real Madrid's clash against Atletico on Wednesday . Despite Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti telling reporters, 'Benzema is not available [for Malaga] but we will have him back for the next game,' Marca lead with the headline 'Benzema still doubtful'. The Madrid-based newspaper claim that Ancelotti is 'hesitating' between playing a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 formation as Gareth Bale and Luka Modric also look likely to miss Wednesday's clash. Marca lead with a similar line as the heap pressure on the Madrid boss by writing, 'Ancelotti searches for a Champions League Madrid without Modric, Bale...and almost surely without Benzema.' Elsewhere is Spain, Mundo Deportivo hail Barcelona coach Luis Enrique for statistically being 'the best coach in history in his first 50 games.' Mundo Deportivo hail 'Mister Lucho' Luis Enrique for his impressive record as Barcelona manager . Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . The Barcelona outlet report that Enrique tops the list for results in his first 50 games in charge with Helenio Herrera in second and Pep Guardiola and Tata Martino tied for third. Over in Italy, Tuttosport celebrate Juventus's march towards the Serie A title following their 2-0 victory against Lazio on Saturday. 'Fest Juve,' or 'Party Juve' reports the Italian newspaper as they look ahead to Massimiliano Allegri's Olympico clash against Torino where the Old Lady can wrap up a fourth consecutive Scudetto.

"Premier League stars including Steven Gerrard, Theo Walcott and Phil Jones could face an advertising watchdog probe they plugged an Adidas  sale on Twitter. Manchester City's David Silva and Everton's Phil Jagielka were also among around a dozen players sponsored by the firm who urged millions of followers to buy the knock-down goods. This comes amid mounting concern that celebrities and sports stars are cashing in by turning Twitter into an advertising platform. The players posted messages within minutes of each other yesterday, with Arsenal forward Walcott tweeting: 'For 25 hours you can get 25% discount on Adidas.co.uk if you use 'friendsoftheo'.' Premier League stars including Arsenal forward Theo Walcott (pictured) could face an advertising watchdog probe they plugged an Adidas sale on Twitter . Silva tweeted: 'Who is up for 25% savings on @adidas products? Click here to find out more! #friendsofdavid.' Guidance from the Advertising Standards Authority states that when there is payment and control from an advertiser, the sponsored tweet should be obviously identifiable. British celebrities have been advised to include the word 'ad' or 'spon' to show if something is an advert or sponsored. The watchdog has previously banned a Nike campaign featuring tweets from Wayne Rooney, one of its brand ambassadors, because they were not clearly identified as promotional messages. Players including Steven Gerrard (pictured) and Everton's Phil Jagielka were  among around a dozen players sponsored by the firm who urged millions of followers to buy the knock-down goods . It was the first UK company to have a Twitter campaign banned, after the ASA ruled in 2012 that the use of the  personal accounts of footballers broke the rules. The Manchester United striker, who has more than 11 million followers, tweeted: 'My resolution — to start the year as a champion, and finish it as a champion...#makeitcount gonike.me/makeitcount'. A tweet from Jack Wilshere said: 'In 2012, I will come back for my club — and be ready for my country.#makeitcount.gonike.me/Makeitcount'. Both footballers were banned from repeating the messages and Nike was warned about ensuring all Twitter advertising is easily identifiable. England footballer Phil Jones and Manchester City's David Silva posted messages within minutes of each other . But another one of Rooney's tweets was said to have not breached advertising rules because its language was markedly different from the footballer's usual Twitter messages. This tweet said: 'The pitches change. The killer instinct doesn't. Own the turf, anywhere. @NikeFootball #myground.' The Advertising Standards Authority has not yet received any complaints about the promotional tweets for Adidas. But a spokesman said: 'If we receive complaints that tweets have broken rules, we will investigate. 'Marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such. 'If any social media account (including celebrity twitter accounts) are tweeting ads and it's not clear from the context that these are marketing communications then they need to be labelled as an ad.' Some fans saw straight through the players' Adidas tweets, with GX Blue ‏tweeting: 'I bet you David Silva didn't write that tweet himself!!' A spokesman for Adidas said: 'To our knowledge, there have not been any complaints about the tweets and we have not been contacted by the ASA with regards to this matter. 'This is a promotion we run several times a year in collaboration with our players to offer fans a sizeable discount and the tweets are clearly identifiable as marketing communication.'"
"When Andriy Shevchenko netted the winning penalty to condemn Juventus to defeat in the 2003 Champions League final, they surely would not have envisaged it would take them this long to get back to Europe's top table. That penalty shootout followed a 0-0 draw which saw AC Milan crowned European champions in the first all-Italian final. Now, after a long journey, Juve are back among the continent's elite. Another goalless draw, this time against Monaco on Wednesday night, was more successful for Turin's Old Lady as they reached the Champions League semi-finals with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona on the horizon. Gianluigi Buffon was celebrated reaching the Champions League semi-finals, 12 years after final heartbreak . Juventus' players salute their supporters after the final whistle in Monaco having made it to the last four . Juve have endured a tough few years but they are now back were they belong among the elite of Europe . The 12-year gap between now and that night at Old Trafford has been one of twists and turns: relegations, promotions, league titles, stripped league titles and European failure at the hands of relative minnows like Fulham and Bordeaux. Captain Gianluigi Buffon said on Wednesday: 'I thought I'd have to wait less when I was at this stage 12 years ago, but seeing the journey was very difficult, we can enjoy this result even more. 'We knew it was a great opportunity and after 12 years we wanted to honour the history of Juve.' Even this season, Bianconeri supporters thought they were as good as out of this tournament as early as late October. A shock defeat by Olympiacos in Athens had them on the brink of exit before they scrambled to a runner-up spot in Group A behind Atletico Madrid. Then Borussia Dortmund gave them a mighty scare in the last-16 before the narrow win over Monaco. Andriy Shevchenko sent Buffon the wrong way with the winning penalty in the Old Trafford final on 2003 . The Juventus players, including Alessandro Del Piero (centre) reflect on their defeat in the showpiece final . Back in 2010, Juventus were downed by Fulham in the Europa League, a side now in the Championship . Pajtim Kasami celebrates after leaving Juve on the brink of exit back in October, but they made it through . Looking back, their group-stage progression is not too dissimilar to the club's fortunes over the last decade. After finishing third in Serie A the season after the 2003 final, Juventus came back to win the league twice in a row - only to be stripped of them both amid Italy's match-fixing scandal that sent them into the second division. On promotion, they took four further years to reach the summit of Italy's top tier once again but piece-by-piece, the nation's most successful side has rebuilt. That hasn't come easy, particularly with their domestic division being overtaken by England's Barclays Premier League, Spain's La Liga and the German Bundesliga. Talent is hard to tempt to Italy - as shown by the failings of AC Milan, Inter Milan, Lazio and Roma. And when the talent does come, it is usually picked off by the big boys from abroad. The Italian champions were relegated to Serie B amid Italy's matchfixing scandal but soon rose back up . Juventus celebrate their second consecutive Serie A title last season, and they are on track for a fourth now . But not at Juventus. The side celebrating on the Stade Louis II pitch on Wednesday night included household names such as Buffon, Carlos Tevez and Arturo Vidal, while Paul Pogba - the most sought-after talent in Europe - is on his way back from injury. He could even be ready for the semi-finals, something any opponent would dread. They haven't conceded in their last three Champions League games - a hallmark of any great Italian side - and their comfortable domestic lead gives them all the time in the world to prepare for their final two or three matches in the competition. Buffon and Carlos Tevez hug on the pitch of the Stade Louis II, and they both have a point to prove . Arturo Vidal is one of the most sought-after midfielders in Europe but he has stuck with Juve until now . Paul Pogba could be back in time for their semi-final next month and will likely be a key player in any clash . Barca, Real and Bayern should beware: the oldest team left in it have a point to prove, and for some this could be their last shot at European glory. Tevez has been linked with a return to South America after nine years in Europe. Andrea Pirlo, Patrice Evra and Buffon are not far from the end of their careers, either. Combine that with the midfield prowess of Pogba and Claudio Marchisio, and the solid defence provided by Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci and they just might do it. Juve will be the team that everyone wants to draw but nobody will enjoy playing against. Roberto Pereyra, Andrea Pirlo, Tevez and  Fernando Llorente celebrate reaching Europe's final four . Pirlo, aged 35, might be facing his best chance of one last European title with the Bianconeri this season . Vidal had it about right after Wednesday's game when he said: 'I am not afraid of anyone. 'I think all four teams in the semi-finals have their qualities and on Friday we'll see who we face, but right now I think we're on a par with all of them. We play with our heads now and are a mature team, I'd say.' The European giants wearing the famous black and white stripes might finally have awoken."
"Sweden’s passport has been named the most powerful in the world, but it turns out it’s also one of the most highly sought-after travel documents on the black market. The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as £6,000 each – far more than the £28 fee that Sweden’s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world’s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium’s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just £9, while Turkey has the most expensive at £166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries – the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US – but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just £28 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn’t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world – behind Sweden, Finland and Germany – with a fee of £73. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's £33 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each."

"Australian Olympian Jana Pittman is believed to have given birth to her second child just days after a video surfaced of the elite athlete training while eight months pregnant. The two-time world champion hurdler has been congratulated by the official Australian Olympic team's Twitter, and Pittman's former agency PACE Sports Management has also offered congratulations on the new addition. Pittman's seven-year-old son Cornelis is now the big brother of a little girl named Emily, who was introduced to her mother's athletic ability while still in the womb. Australian Olympian Jana Pittman is believed to have given birth to her second child, a daughter named Emily . The two-time world champion hurdler has been congratulated by the official Australian Olympic team's Twitter . Footage of the heavily pregnant hurdler showed Pittman doing a training run on Sunday, just a day before going into labour, reported 9news. Emily was  born at a healthy 3.1 kilograms on Monday, reported The Brisbane Times. The 32-year-old plans to compete in both the Beijing World Championships and the 2016 Rio Olympics, which means that she was chose to incorporate training into her pregnancy right up until the final trimester. Pittman continued to train while she was pregnant with Cornelis, and won her second world title for hurdles seven months after he was born in 2006. The athlete's coach, Mike Hurst, said that Pittman trained every second day and was careful to monitor her core temperature throughout her training program. The 32-year-old was filmed training for the 2016 Rio Olympics the day before she went into labour . The 32-year-old plans to compete in both the Beijing World Championships and the 2016 Rio Olympics . 'Jana said when she came to train that she wanted to go to Rio and she was trying to get pregnant. That was the plan from the outset and that was how she has managed it,' he told The Brisbane Times. 'Jana is a two-time world champion and she is doing third-year medicine and one of her interests is in obstetrics. She has been very careful in how she has managed her training.' 'She also knew her body and said some days she could not train,' Mr Hurst said. Pittman's new daughter was conceived with an IVF donor, and opened up about her second child to Woman's Day, telling the publication this week that she feels 'extraordinarily lucky.' 'I can't wait to meet my baby girl, she's my little miracle!'
