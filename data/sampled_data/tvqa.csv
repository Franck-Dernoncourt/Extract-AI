It's something else. Something personal.  House : Give me the file.  House : Looks like this'll be fun.  Cameron : The twitch could be a miniseizure, unrelated to the diabetes.  Chase : Brain tumor?  House : Glad you could join us, Eric.  House : What's the differential for a twitch in the wrist? The patient's a 30-ish Jane Doe. I thought I just discharged her.  Wilson : Well, she's my patient. No harm in a second opinion.  Chase : A blow to the head? A subdural hematoma?  Foreman : Read the file. No evidence of cranial trauma.  Cameron : - A twitch could indicate a brain tumor. - Or about a dozen other things!  Foreman : Come on. There's two things homeless people are good at...  Foreman : Getting sick and running scams.

Foreman : I've known a lot more homeless people than you have. - Yes, you've got that going for you. "

Harris : Mike was a junior analyst in our acquisition department.  Harris : He was a good kid. Bright future.  Beckett : I understand that he took a leave of absence a month ago.  Beckett : Did he give you a reason why?  Harris : Personal issues.  Harris : He didn't say why but I could tell it was serious.  Castle : So, you have no idea why he would have a fake ID and $60,000 cash? No.  Harris : But maybe it had something to do with that woman  Harris : that tried to break into his office yesterday.  Beckett : Who was that I don't know?  Harris : She was gone before security got there.  Beckett : And who reported it?  Amy : I had stepped out of negotiations to go to the restroom.  Amy : And in the hallway, I noticed a woman was trying to pick an office-door lock  Amy : using a wrench and an opened-up paper clip.

" Castle : They took all the evidence.  Castle : And I let it happen. AII because I wanted to impress Beckett.  Castle : Sorry, Beckett. I screwed up.  Beckett : Yeah, you did.  Castle : And I jeopardized the entire case.  Beckett : Again, yes.  Beckett : But you know what, if it wasn't for you, then we'd still be thinking  Beckett : that Peter's prison uniform was a Halloween costume.  Esposito : So, I've been digging into Dr. Lillstrom. Did you know that for the past decade she's been contracting with the Army?  Esposito : Working psy-ops?  Castle : Wait a minute.  Castle : The Navy funded the first, the original Stanford Prison Experiment.  Castle : Maybe the Army is behind Dr. Lillstrom's modern-day incarnation.  Esposito : That would explain how the place was scrubbed so quickly.  Beckett : Now, why would the military be interested  Beckett : in a bunch of college students playing prison?  Esposito : Well, the government's in need of new counter-terrorism techniques,  Esposito : aimed at the millennial generation.  Esposito : How to get into the minds ofyoung terrorists and break them.  Beckett : And what better source of lab rats than the millennials here at home?  Esposito : But we'll never get those surveillance tapes back,  Esposito : so how do we prove that Lillstrom left the prison  Esposito : to kill Peter after he escaped?  Beckett : We need a confession.  Castle : Well, the doc likes mind games, right?  Lillstrom : Charge me or let me go. Which sounds better, ""Negligent infliction of emotional distress,"" or ""Gross psychological abuse""? "

Esposito : I'm on it. Hotel says only one key card was issued to the victim. It was last used to enter the victim's room at 3 : 18 a.m.  Beckett : Okay, well, that coincides with time of death.  Beckett : Where are the bride and groom?  Ryan : Bridal suite at the end of the hall. Greg and Kyra.  Beckett : Okay, have uniforms assemble the wedding guests in the bar  Beckett : - to be interviewed. - Where's Castle?  Beckett : I don't know. Figured the death of a bridesmaid would be right up his alley.  Ryan : Heard ""wedding"" and probably got cold feet. Hmm... Huh. Yeah.  Beckett : When was the last time that you saw Sophie?  Kyra : At the rehearsal dinner last night. I don't even think I talked to her.  Kyra : She came all this way for us, and I don't think I even said hello.  Greg : It's not your fault, Kyra. It was a crazy day.  Kyra : Did you talk to her after I went up to bed?  Greg : No. You know how Uncle Teddy is.  Greg : He wouldn't let me leave without doing tequila shots. I escaped up to my room around 1 : 00.  Greg : I'm not sure if Sophie was still at the bar.  Beckett : The two of you weren't in the same room last night? No.  Greg : It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.  Beckett : Is there anything else you can tell me about Sophie?  Beckett : Was she in a relationship? Did she have any enemies? "

Cross : I am the backup.  Castle : You're in no condition...  Cross : You don't understand. This list cannot get out into the open.  Beckett : Then we'll go.  Beckett : Castle's right. You are in no condition.  Beckett : And if we stop him, then we all get what we want.  Cross : Let's run this just so we know we're all on the same page.  Cross : Richard, what do you do?  Castle : As soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in, I download the list. You don't just log in, you gotta be first.  Castle : - Right. - But why does he have to be first?  Castle : Because it locks out the Iranians from downloading the list. Right. And while Castle's downloading,  Beckett : I'll track the signal using the Wi-Fi analyzer on my phone.  Martha : You can find a spy on your phone? Mother, there's an app for everything now.  Cross : Now, Kate, remember, if you don't have a tactical advantage,  Cross : just get eyes on him. He's CIA.

Castle : Because black-tailed pythons, also known as Indian rock pythons,  Castle : are not indigenous to that area.  Castle : Why would they be coming from Africa?  Ryan : Why do you care about some motherfreaking snakes  Esposito : on a motherfreaking plane?  Castle : Because as a murder mystery novelist, I am highly paid to think like a bad guy.  Castle : Here are a few fun facts about snakes, they are cold-blooded,  Castle : they swallow huge amounts and they digest their food very slowly.  Beckett : Perfect for smuggling. there are two things in abundance in South Africa, racial hatred and diamonds.  Esposito : Smuggling diamonds in live snakes. That's why the Maitlans' trip had to be this week.  Castle : They knew the shipment was coming in.  Castle : - And then the ketamine... - Was to dope the snakes,  Beckett : so they could take them up the shaft without a fight. - And then when we came to the store... - The owner couldn't say a word,  Castle : otherwise he'd implicate himself in smuggling. - So, we find out who robbed him. - We find the Third Man.  Ryan : Do they know they're finishing each other's sentences?  Beckett : Have uniforms pick up the owner, we'll meet you at the store. Hi, is this seat taken? - My name's Brad. What should we tell them?  Castle : This is going to be awkward. They'll be okay. "

Ooh. That is just one month after this letter was written.  Esposito : And a week after Gabriel Shaw was sent to Peakmore.  Dave Holmby : Wait a minute, if Shaw was institutionalized,  Castle : it's possible he didn't know Karl Von Eckland was dead.

Geraldine : Only thing that makes sense is that he booked a gig on the side  Geraldine : and cut me out of my commission.  Ryan : Do you have any idea what that gig was?  Geraldine : No, but for him to pull in that kind of money,  LAUGHS it had to be something big.  Castle : The key here is that mystery gig. A down-on-his-luck actor, barely scraping by.  Castle : Maybe he got involved in some shady deal that cost him his life.  Ryan : Or someone recognized his true acting talent and gave him a job.

Nate : Why don't you take her for a ride? Nate? Nate?  Cameron : His heart rate's normal. Respiration's even.  Enid : What's happening? What's the matter with him?  Chase : He's jaundiced. His liver's shutting down. CHASE : We've started him on sodium polystyrene sulfonate. His liver's operating at about 20%  Chase : and deteriorating fast.  House : Which means he'll be dead long before Foreman turns in his parking pass.  House : So what causes personality disorder, head pain, blah, blah, blah,  House : and liver failure?  Chase : Liver failure can cause hypogonadism, head pain.  Chase : Altered mental status leads to the personality disorder and rage.  Chase : All we need to do is figure out what caused the liver failure.  House : Yes. Also, we need to figure out how symptoms yesterday  House : can be caused by liver failure today.  Cameron : If his liver's failing now, it wasn't great yesterday.  Cameron : If it wasn't operating at capacity, it could have caused...  EXCLAIMING   House : Don't sneak up on a person like that!

"He's pushing where there's nothing.  Foreman : Cameron, you are an excellent doctor.  Foreman : You'll get lots of tearful thank-yous from grateful patients.  Cameron : Yeah, am I such a bitch for wanting that? Well, it's not a bad thing. But it's not why I'm here.  Foreman : I took this fellowship to learn from House.  Cameron : He's teaching you to be a masochist.  Chase : Dry eyes goes on the board. In eight years, the patient experienced 214 symptoms, many of them repeating.  House : Any patterns?  Chase : Fever plus frequent urination could mean prostatitis.  Foreman : Or a urinary tract infection.  Chase : White count was normal. No infection.  Foreman : If you add pain into the mix, fever,  Chase : frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem.  House : I like it.  Chase : No. Creatinine and BUN were both normal.  House : Not the kidney part. The pain part.  House : Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal pancreatic cysts. Perfect. You've managed to pick the one symptom he never had.  House : Abdominal pain.  House : It's the first symptom on the board. Grunt.  Cameron : Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain. No. The traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm and vibration of the larynx, leading to the audible sound. ""I have a pain in my abdomen.""  Cameron : Richard's symptoms are culled from eight years of medical history.  Cameron : They're not patterned. These are random, individual events over time.  House : Illnesses have incubation periods. Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.  Foreman : His throat will collapse. Muscle degeneration  Foreman : in his neck won't tolerate the scope.

Beckett : Well, why don't we get the witness together with a sketch artist?  Javier Esposito : Already in the works.  Javier Esposito : And to hear the jogger tell it, this chick was cool as can be.  Javier Esposito : She may be a pro. Does raise the question, what was Henry doing here so late at night?  Ryan : Waiting for someone.  Ryan : CSU found cigarette butts that match the pack in his pocket.  Esposito : And if he was up to no good, it wouldn't be his first time.  Esposito : He did a nickel at Elmira for aggravated assault,  Esposito : got out a few years ago.  Beckett : He's still got his work uniform on.  Beckett : So let's see if anyone at Go Quick Towing knows how he wound up here.  Esposito : Let's go. He wasn't on the job, I could tell you that. We didn't have any pick-ups out that way, so I don't know what he was doing there.  Beckett : Well, who would? Did he have any family? He doesn't. He didn't even have a girl, I don't think. Poor guy. I don't know, I just... I just can't get over it. Uh... Henry was my top driver. Just a real stand-up guy.  Castle : Even though he had a record? So do I. There's not a lot of jobs out there for ex-cons. But Henry, he, uh, he was out of the life, so I gave him a shot and I never regretted it.  Beckett : Did he have problems with anyone that you know of? Oh, yeah. Henry got threatened every day.  Castle : He did? By whom? All kinds of people. Waving bats, knives, guns, you name it. "

House : Open the hangar, here comes the plane.  Emmy : There's nothing else you can try?  Taub : No. There's a drug that manages the symptoms but it's not a cure.  Emmy : Let's try that.  Taub : You don't want to have the surgery? Understand.  House : There's not many people who have the guts to admit they'd rather be pretty than healthy.  House : Income's better and you get more action. We'll start you on your drug treatment right away.  Taub : I bought it. I bought that it was really about  Emmy : trying to make people's lives a little better.  Kutner : You're surprised she's superficial?  Kutner : You're a plastic surgeon. This is the human condition.  Taub : No, she's a freak.  Kutner : Every time you put someone under to bob their nose,  Emmy : you were risking their life. What?  Kutner : No singing. She's better.

So, you think maybe Grey's Anatomy got it all wrong?  Foreman : Lymph system circulates fluid, not organ cells.  Cameron : Cancer cells break into the lymphatic system all the time.  Chase : But we're not talking about cancer cells.  House : What's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells?  House : Why can one pass through walls but the other can't?  Cameron : Cancer cells are damaged. Lets them grow into blood vessels.  Cameron : Go wherever they want. So if the liver cells are damaged-- liver isn't damaged.  Foreman : The tests were normal.  House : So if the liver cells are damaged, it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system.  House : Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, even the heart issues.  Cameron : Liver cells are fine.  Cameron : He was immunized for hep A and B, and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles? "

If you wanna focus on the fact  House : that you're not gonna see 50, that's your choice.  Nicole : You know what? I agree with you.  Thirteen : My self-pity's optional. What about yours? Yeah.

House : Not quite. You did a spinal tap and the headaches got worse.  Chase : We're maxing him out on morphine.  House : He sprung a leak. He's losing CSF from the tap site.  Taub : We made his headaches worse?  House : Just you, actually.  Chase : That still wouldn't explain why he got the headaches in the first place.

Oh, right. I forgot how much you care about what people think.  Wilson : Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel? That's, uh... They cause lung cancer, you know.  House : You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer,  House : colorectal cancer, prostate cancer... And not for lung cancer?  Wilson : They ran out of colors?  House : It's because people blame lung cancer patients. They smoke. They screwed up. They deserve to die.  House : The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt. "

No.  Thirteen : If he's two people, then we're all two people and we just don't know it. And what does that say about identity?

House : I was sitting by his bed all morning, just so he'd know someone was there for him.  Wilson : I looked in on him. He's much better.  House : Ergo, the treatment's working. Ergo, me right, you wrong.  Foreman : Hey, I'm glad for the kid.  Wilson : That smugness of yours really is an attractive quality. Thank you.  House : It was either that or get my hair highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.

"This 32-year-old female was admitted by my staff, because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh. The patient rapidly deteriorated and now has severe congestive heart failure. Pressors and vasodilators have not improved her condition whatsoever. Pulmonary function tests show an F.E.C. of over three liters, with F.E. V.-1 of at least 90% of predicted... and preserved F.E.D./F.E.C. ratio and preserved D.L.C.O. as well. Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19% with no focal wall motion abnormalities. Heart catheterization revealed clean left, right and circumflex arteries. And a subsequent biopsy revealed irreversible cardiomyopathy. Which is why we're here.  Cuddy : Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused by your time and date stamps.  Cuddy : It appears that you put Carly on the transplant list before you did these tests.  House : I had a hunch.  Cuddy : You don't have hunches. You know.  House : Look, if the tests had come back differently, obviously I would have taken her off the list.  House : But on the long shot... On the long shot that I was right, I didn't want to waste time.  Cuddy : Is there any exclusion criteria we should know about?  House : CAT scan revealed no tumors, and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.  Cuddy : What about any other criteria? "

We have an infection spreading in the hospital.  Wilson : These kids have totally unrelated illnesses.  House : They fell sick within four hours of each other.  House : They had the same delivery rooms, maternity rooms are neighboring, so transmission's possible.  House : - They have the same symptoms. - The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction.  Wilson : No matter how close their beds are, I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.  House : What does bowel obstruction on a chart indicate?  Wilson : Normally I'd say it indicates a patient's bowel is obstructed,  Wilson : but I'm pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart.  House : It means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the patient's bowel is obstructed.  Wilson : Okay, you're upset because they threw you out of their lounge. - Look at the X-ray. It's a normal gas pattern. If you want, I can get you a key to the oncology lounge.  House : Air in the colon. We're getting TiVo.  House : If it's air, no bowel obstruction.  Wilson : Even if it is air, it could have been there before the obstruction.  House : No. Something's infected both these infants.  Cuddy : And you're the only one who put this together because...  House : Because I'm the only one who looked at both kids.  House : I want them isolated. I want the maternity ward shut down.  Cuddy : Because you're better at reading an X-ray than a radiologist.  House : Radiologists always overread babies' X-rays, especially if they're asked to rule out a pathology.  House : - He read into it what he wanted. - Which is exactly what you're doing.

Beckett : Would you like to tell me why? It began two years ago. With this.  Beckett : I don't understand what a car driving through the desert  Beckett : has to do with Dale Tanner. Intelligence reports said there were three high-ranking Afghan militants in this car.  Warburg : It was the right make and model, traveling at a high rate of speed.  Warburg : So the drone pilot was given the green light to strike.  Warburg : But then, he saw those red dots on the trunk  Warburg : and he had a feeling. So he aborted the mission.  Warburg : There were no militants in that car. The red dots were roses.  Warburg : Because the young couple driving down that desert road  Warburg : had just gotten married.  Warburg : That's when I knew I could no longer be a part of the drone program. But I don't understand why. The pilot didn't fire.  Warburg : Because the next generation of drones won't have pilots. The new Al software will give drones decision-making capability.  Warburg : They'll assess the data and take lethal action all on their own.  Castle : Really will be rise of the machines.  Warburg : Those new drones would turn that car to ash without hesitation.  Warburg : That's why, when lives are at stake,  Warburg : we need a man who sees roses.  Warburg : We need the human factor.  Beckett : And where was the human factor when you killed Dale Tanner?  Warburg : Let me show you something.  Warburg : I wrote this program myself.

Something bad. Here. That should help with the swelling.  Eric : Yes. But not my pride.  Eric : You know, with your bedside manner, you could've been a doctor.  Beckett : Me? No. No. A lawyer maybe. I was in pre-law. I could've represented you in your case against the cork.  Eric : But instead you became a cop. Why?

Doyle : It was able to stop their weapons. It completely turned the tide.  Doyle : Detective, listen to me. Ward is still obviously fighting for the fascists! They're trying to win the war by re-writing history.  Doyle : And if he kills Deschile, there will be no energy shield!  Doyle : And without that energy shield, we lose that war! Ward's gonna kill Deschile and that is why billions of people die!  Beckett : Okay, you know what? We don't have time for this.  Beckett : Take him to holding, please.  Doyle : Fine, we don't have time. You're correct, okay?  Doyle : Forget everything I said.  Doyle : Forget about time travel, forget about wars, none of that matters!  Doyle : All that matters is Deschile! You understand me?  Doyle : You keep him alive! He cannot die! No, Deschile. Yeah, Paul Deschile. "

Mundy : Not likely.  Mundy : See, it has fenders, or pads, to protect the paint.  Mundy : And the position of the fenders points to it being moored at a dock.  Beckett : Is there any way to know where that dock is?  Mundy : I can give you my best guess.  Mundy : The dinghy had a six-horse motor,  Mundy : two hours' worth of fuel, if the tanks were full.  Mundy : After it ran dry, it drifted for four or five days.  Mundy : So, based on winds and current vectors,  Mundy : it probably launched  Mundy : somewhere between Rhode Island and southern Maine.  Esposito : Looks like we caught a break. Turns out that sky-blue dinghy was a standard white  Esposito : when it came out of the factory.  Beckett : And how does that help us?  Esposito : Well, the previous owner pimped it out. He added custom fishing-rod holders and painted it sky blue.  Ryan : Making it a relative rarity in the world of dinghies.

ZOMBIE : Yeah, if we tag them, we turn them. And then they become zombies, too.  Paul : Look, if this is because we didn't get a permit... BECKETT : It's not!  Beckett : You're all coming with me now. How did I not know about this?  Castle : This is outstanding! Did you do this yourself? Ugh! CASTLE : Being a fan of zombie lore, I get it.  Castle : But what's the appeal of being a zombie?  Castle : Look at this guy.  Castle : Who would want to be alive in a decayed, mindless state?  Castle : Being a vampire, that I understand.  Castle : That's the romantic route to immortality.  Castle : The gentleman's monster, as it were.  Beckett : Speaking of monsters,  Beckett : none of these zombies match the photo of our killer.  Castle : Maybe he's trying out a new look.  Castle : How about you?  Castle : If you could be any supernatural creature, what would it be?  Beckett : Van Helsing, no question.  Castle : Monster slayer. Befitting.  Beckett : And imagine,  Beckett : the monster that we are hunting might be in this very room. All right, ladies, thanks for your help.

Esposito : We reached the airline.  Esposito : Omar Dixon was definitely on that flight to Beirut, by way of Abu Dhabi.  Beckett : Why Beirut? He's got family there on his mom's side. And dual citizenship.  Esposito : He flew out on a Lebanese passport.  Beckett : Can we have him detained when he lands? Nope. There's no extradition agreement.  Esposito : Probably why he went there.  Castle : And it's an excellent part of the world  Castle : if you want to sell some drone-hacking software. Speaking of drone-hacking, say hello to our friend Omar Dixon.  Stack : See you later, Omar.  Beckett : I thought he was heading to Beirut.  Stack : He was. Until I asked the Attorney General to contact the FAA  Stack : and have them recall the flight back to JFK. You know, one of the perks of working for an 800-pound gorilla.  Beckett : Did you already interview him?  Stack : Well, you are the reason we got him, Detective Beckett.  Stack : Why don't you do the honors?  Stack : Look at that.  Stack : How she uses the silence. She is a force to be reckoned with. Oh, you don't know the half of it. "

Foreman : He's not dead or sentimental,  Foreman : and somebody needs to do it.  Cuddy : Not necessarily.  Cuddy : Departments of diagnostic medicine don't exist.  Cuddy : The only reason we have one is because of House.  Foreman : You reassigned us, kept us on payroll for three months,  Foreman : you might as well give me a chance.  Cuddy : You're a great doctor,  Cuddy : I want you to stay on in Neuro, but House was a genius.  Foreman : House was an egotistical, pill-popping, lawsuit magnet.  Foreman : And a genius.  Foreman : And I worked with him longer than anybody else. I can do this.  Cuddy : You get one shot.  Taub : What's House gonna do?  Foreman : No idea, but he's gone,  Foreman : so how about we focus on the medicine? What?  Thirteen : You're the boss, it's kind of sexy.  Taub : Here I thought it was just the pants.  Taub : Diabetic neuropathy?  Foreman : HbA1c looks fine.  Foreman : Could be hypothyroidism.  Thirteen : No fatigue or weight gain.  Thirteen : What about complex regional pain syndrome?  Taub : That's a good idea. Let's run with it.  Foreman : Look at that. No House, the job still gets done.  Thirteen : And yet, something's missing.  Taub : I'm short, he's black, you're gay-ish.  Thirteen : That's it.  Foreman : Treat for CRPS. Prep the patient for spinal stimulation. "

Taub : Fluids aren't draining properly.  House : Temptation to come screw with me just too much for you? There's gotta be a better reason. He needs surgery to drain it.  House : Oh, and I think I mentioned this earlier. You're fired. What you did was over the line. Get out.  Cuddy : But don't go anywhere. You're not fired, yet. No one is firing anyone in the middle of this case.  Cuddy : Not while those cameras are here,  Cuddy : and not while Taub is the only person that this father trusts.  Cuddy : Where are you going?  House : To do what I always do in these situations.  House : Treat my patient behind his back.  Cuddy : That's one option.  Cuddy : Or you can do a CT scan of the kid's head.  Cuddy : If there's no midline shift, we know Taub's wrong  Cuddy : and you get your consent to give the kid steroids.  House : Just a warning.  House : If we have to start getting consent every time we do a procedure,  House : soon they'll be asking for informed consent.  Foreman : Didn't think you had the guts to stage a coup.  Taub : Coup failed. I'm scheduled for execution at dawn.  Foreman : No, you're not.  Taub : No reprieve from the governor.  Foreman : You're a test result away from becoming House's front runner.

And this part, this part I want you to know, 'cause this part I'm not ashamed of, 'cause at least we tried to do something. It wasn't pretty and it wasn't legal, but it was right. Kidnapping people for a ransom was right? We called it incarceration. Yeah. We'd grab them off the street and we'd take them somewhere and we'd tune them up. We put the fear of God into them, at least for a while. But we knew we couldn't hold them forever. So we set bail. And I'm here to tell you that we set it high.

The bailiff called us to come get you.  Castle : I'm going to figure out what happened.  Castle : I promise. Are you out ofyour mind?  Castle : I didn't do anything wrong.  Beckett : You tricked a judge to postpone a trial,  Beckett : and then you illegally questioned the defendant.  Castle : Yeah, but other than that, I didn't do anything wrong.  Esposito : Yo, Beckett, Castle's convinced that Nina is innocent now.  Beckett : Because what? Because Sadie wanted Roger's glass?  Castle : I think she was after his DNA. Why? Roger was her cameraman for 20 years.  Castle : Nina said that Sadie had had affairs with men in the past. Maybe they'd had one,  Castle : and Sadie's daughter was actually Roger's.  Beckett : So, uh, what, you think that Sadie cooked this whole thing up  Beckett : so she could get a DNA sample for a paternity test?  Castle : Only one way to find out. "

She's got a notation in here for 3 : 00 p.m. yesterday. It just says, ""T.J.""  Beckett : And nothing else?  Ryan : Nope. Maybe T.J. was a ghost coming to visit.  Ryan : Mediums are the ones that can see ghosts, right, Castle?  Castle : Yes, psychics can tell the future.  Castle : Mediums can tell the future and talk to the dead.

He doesn't need a tutor,  Foreman : he needs Ritalin and a babysitter. Consider the forms incentive. If Taub doesn't pass, they will become a permanent part of your life.  Taub : This isn't really about Cuddy, is it? It's about you.  Taub : You don't want to lose me.  Taub : I think you care. You don't think you can disgust me  House : into pulling Foreman off you.

Cuddy : He'll put her back on the antibiotics that almost suffocated her.  Taub : What do we do?  House : We push through this.

GEORGE : - You decannulated a heart. - I didn't.  GEORGE : Yes, you did. And when Burke and I were fishing, I noticed something weird with his hand. Like a spasm. I'm sorry.

House : As plain as the nose on our faces. And the nose on his face.  Chase : What's going on? What did he say?  House : No hairs and cauterization scars.  Foreman : Which means? He had it cauterized. How could you know that?  House : Because it makes sense.  House : Undoubtedly done to stop the same childhood nosebleeds  House : that plagued his grandfather.  House : Undoubtedly because they were both born with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. "

Foreman : It's barely elevated,  Foreman : which you'd expect given the number of procedures he's undergone.  Chase : Well, barely is more than not barely.  House : Not my decision.  House : But if it was, I'd say start him on prednisone  House : and get a testicular biopsy. If he's gonna have any real inflammation, it'll be down there.  Foreman : Cameron and I will do it.  Cameron : Why? It was Chase's idea. Kid's father is not gonna be happy about a fourth set of biopsies,  Formean : and you've got a better rapport.  Cameron : What's really going on here?
